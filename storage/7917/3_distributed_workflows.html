    <h2> Distributed Workflows </h2>

<p>Suppose that Alice has started a new project with a git repository in
/home/alice/project, and that Bob, who has a home directory on the
same machine, wants to contribute.</p>

<p>Bob begins with:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone /home/alice/project myrepo
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a new directory "myrepo" containing a clone of Alice's
repository.  The clone is on an equal footing with the original
project, possessing its own copy of the original project's history.</p>

<p>Bob then makes some changes and commits them:</p>

<pre><code>(edit files)
$ git commit -a
(repeat as necessary)
</code></pre>

<p>When he's ready, he tells Alice to pull changes from the repository
at /home/bob/myrepo.  She does this with:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd /home/alice/project
$ git pull /home/bob/myrepo master
</code></pre>

<p>This merges the changes from Bob's "master" branch into Alice's
current branch.  If Alice has made her own changes in the meantime,
then she may need to manually fix any conflicts.  (Note that the
"master" argument in the above command is actually unnecessary, as it
is the default.)</p>

<p>The "pull" command thus performs two operations: it fetches changes
from a remote branch, then merges them into the current branch.</p>

<p>When you are working in a small closely knit group, it is not
unusual to interact with the same repository over and over
again.  By defining 'remote' repository shorthand, you can make
it easier:</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote add bob /home/bob/myrepo
</code></pre>

<p>With this, Alice can perform the first operation alone using the
"git fetch" command without merging them with her own branch,
using:</p>

<pre><code>$ git fetch bob
</code></pre>

<p>Unlike the longhand form, when Alice fetches from Bob using a
remote repository shorthand set up with <code>git remote</code>, what was
fetched is stored in a remote tracking branch, in this case
<code>bob/master</code>.  So after this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log -p master..bob/master
</code></pre>

<p>shows a list of all the changes that Bob made since he branched from
Alice's master branch.</p>

<p>After examining those changes, Alice
could merge the changes into her master branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ git merge bob/master
</code></pre>

<p>This <code>merge</code> can also be done by 'pulling from her own remote
tracking branch', like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git pull . remotes/bob/master
</code></pre>

<p>Note that git pull always merges into the current branch,
regardless of what else is given on the command line.</p>

<p>Later, Bob can update his repo with Alice's latest changes using</p>

<pre><code>$ git pull
</code></pre>

<p>Note that he doesn't need to give the path to Alice's repository;
when Bob cloned Alice's repository, git stored the location of her
repository in the repository configuration, and that location is
used for pulls:</p>

<pre><code>$ git config --get remote.origin.url
/home/alice/project
</code></pre>

<p>(The complete configuration created by git-clone is visible using
"git config -l", and the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-config.html">git config</a> man page
explains the meaning of each option.)</p>

<p>Git also keeps a pristine copy of Alice's master branch under the
name "origin/master":</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch -r
  origin/master
</code></pre>

<p>If Bob later decides to work from a different host, he can still
perform clones and pulls using the ssh protocol:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone alice.org:/home/alice/project myrepo
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, git has a native protocol, or can use rsync or http;
see <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-pull.html">git pull</a> for details.</p>

<p>Git can also be used in a CVS-like mode, with a central repository
that various users push changes to; see <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-push.html">git push</a> and
link:cvs-migration.html[git for CVS users].</p>

<h3> Public git repositories </h3>

<p>Another way to submit changes to a project is to tell the maintainer
of that project to pull the changes from your repository using
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-pull.html">git pull</a>.  In the section "&lt;&lt;getting-updates-with-git-pull,
Getting updates with git-pull&gt;&gt;" we described this as a way to get
updates from the "main" repository, but it works just as well in the
other direction.</p>

<p>If you and the maintainer both have accounts on the same machine, then
you can just pull changes from each other's repositories directly;
commands that accept repository URLs as arguments will also accept a
local directory name:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone /path/to/repository
$ git pull /path/to/other/repository
</code></pre>

<p>or an ssh URL:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone ssh://yourhost/~you/repository
</code></pre>

<p>For projects with few developers, or for synchronizing a few private
repositories, this may be all you need.</p>

<p>However, the more common way to do this is to maintain a separate public
repository (usually on a different host) for others to pull changes
from.  This is usually more convenient, and allows you to cleanly
separate private work in progress from publicly visible work.</p>

<p>You will continue to do your day-to-day work in your personal
repository, but periodically "push" changes from your personal
repository into your public repository, allowing other developers to
pull from that repository.  So the flow of changes, in a situation
where there is one other developer with a public repository, looks
like this:</p>

<pre><code>                        you push
  your personal repo ------------------&gt; your public repo
    ^                                     |
    |                                     |
    | you pull                            | they pull
    |                                     |
    |                                     |
        |               they push             V
  their public repo &lt;------------------- their repo
</code></pre>

<h3> Pushing changes to a public repository </h3>

<p>Note that the two techniques outlined above (exporting via
&lt;&lt;exporting-via-http,http&gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt;exporting-via-git,git&gt;&gt;) allow other
maintainers to fetch your latest changes, but they do not allow write
access, which you will need to update the public repository with the
latest changes created in your private repository.</p>

<p>The simplest way to do this is using <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-push.html">git push</a> and ssh; to
update the remote branch named "master" with the latest state of your
branch named "master", run</p>

<pre><code>$ git push ssh://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git master:master
</code></pre>

<p>or just</p>

<pre><code>$ git push ssh://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git master
</code></pre>

<p>As with git-fetch, git-push will complain if this does not result in a
&lt;&lt;fast-forwards,fast forward&gt;&gt;; see the following section for details on
handling this case.</p>

<p>Note that the target of a "push" is normally a
&lt;&lt;def<em>bare</em>repository,bare&gt;&gt; repository.  You can also push to a
repository that has a checked-out working tree, but the working tree
will not be updated by the push.  This may lead to unexpected results if
the branch you push to is the currently checked-out branch!</p>

<p>As with git-fetch, you may also set up configuration options to
save typing; so, for example, after</p>

<pre><code>$ cat &gt;&gt;.git/config &lt;&lt;EOF
[remote "public-repo"]
    url = ssh://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git
EOF
</code></pre>

<p>you should be able to perform the above push with just</p>

<pre><code>$ git push public-repo master
</code></pre>

<p>See the explanations of the remote.<name>.url, branch.<name>.remote,
and remote.<name>.push options in <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-config.html">git config</a> for
details.</name></name></name></p>

<h3> What to do when a push fails </h3>

<p>If a push would not result in a &lt;&lt;fast-forwards,fast forward&gt;&gt; of the
remote branch, then it will fail with an error like:</p>

<pre><code>error: remote 'refs/heads/master' is not an ancestor of
local  'refs/heads/master'.
Maybe you are not up-to-date and need to pull first?
error: failed to push to 'ssh://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git'
</code></pre>

<p>This can happen, for example, if you:</p>

<pre><code>- use `git-reset --hard` to remove already-published commits, or
- use `git-commit --amend` to replace already-published commits
  (as in &lt;&lt;fixing-a-mistake-by-rewriting-history&gt;&gt;), or
- use `git-rebase` to rebase any already-published commits (as
  in &lt;&lt;using-git-rebase&gt;&gt;).
</code></pre>

<p>You may force git-push to perform the update anyway by preceding the
branch name with a plus sign:</p>

<pre><code>$ git push ssh://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git +master
</code></pre>

<p>Normally whenever a branch head in a public repository is modified, it
is modified to point to a descendant of the commit that it pointed to
before.  By forcing a push in this situation, you break that convention.
(See &lt;&lt;problems-with-rewriting-history&gt;&gt;.)</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this is a common practice for people that need a simple
way to publish a work-in-progress patch series, and it is an acceptable
compromise as long as you warn other developers that this is how you
intend to manage the branch.</p>

<p>It's also possible for a push to fail in this way when other people have
the right to push to the same repository.  In that case, the correct
solution is to retry the push after first updating your work: either by a
pull, or by a fetch followed by a rebase; see the
&lt;&lt;setting-up-a-shared-repository,next section&gt;&gt; and
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitcvs-migration.html">gitcvs-migration</a> for more.</p>
