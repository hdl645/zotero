I want to provide another netmask to the Windows PPTP client. I set the option 
"netmask <somenetmask>" in the options file, but it does not work. How do I do it?
</somenetmask></i></p><i></i>
<i><font size="+2">A.</font></i>
A Windows machine sets the netmask on a PPTP client setup to 255.255.255.255, which
is a hostmask. This is quite correct, since PPTP is a Point-to-point connection.
The Windows machine sets the broadcast according to RFC:<br>
<ul>10.x.x.x (Class A) &nbsp; 10.255.255.255</ul>
<ul>172.16.x.x (Class B) &nbsp; 172.16.255.255</ul>
<ul>192.168.x.x (Class C) &nbsp; 192.168.x.255</ul>
<br>
You have to renumber, set the client IP configuration static, or have the person 
on the clientmachine execute a batchfile which fixes things.

I can connect to the server and ping to it fine, but I can't ping any other hosts on the
office subnet.  I have ip-forwarding turned on and I have proxyarp set
in the ppp/options file.  What can be wrong?</i>
</p>
<p>
<i><font size="+2">A.</font></i>
There seem to be a lot of questions floating around about routing and
masq'ing associated with this issue.
</p>
<p>

Well, my curiosity got the best of me, so I thought I would check this
out.  Shown below is my test setup for investigating this problem.
</p>
<img src="q2.png" border="0">
<p>

For the sake of simplicity, we will ignore address translation issues
associated with the firewall.  This assumes that the client at
192.168.8.142 is going to use 192.168.56.11 as its target address for
the pptp connection to pptp_srvr.  The firewall will block all access to
the 192.168.56.0 subnet except for pptp connections associated with
pptp_srvr.  This can be implemented with, for example, ipchains
</p>
<pre>ipchains -P input DENY
ipchains -P forward DENY
ipchains -A input 192.168.56.0/24 -j ACCEPT  /* allow connections from inside */
ipchains -A input -p tcp -d 192.168.56.11 1723 -j ACCEPT
ipchains -A input -p 47 -d 192.168.56.11 -j ACCEPT
ipchains -A forward -p tcp -d 192.168.56.11 1723 -j ACCEPT
ipchains -A forward -p tcp -s 192.168.56.11 1723 -j ACCEPT
ipchains -A forward -p 47 -d 192.168.56.11 -j ACCEPT
ipchains -A forward -p 47 -s 192.168.56.11 -j ACCEPT
ipchains -A forward -i ppp+ -d 192.168.56.0/24 -j ACCEPT /* allow from clients to inside */
ipchains -A forward -i ppp+ -s 192.168.56.0/24 -j ACCEPT /* allow from inside to clients */
</pre>
<p>

When you connect from client to pptp_srvr, you will be able to complete
the connection and ping to pptp_srvr.  However, if you attempt to ping
host, at 192.168.56.12, this will fail.
</p>
<p>

A clue to this problem can be found in the /var/tmp/messages file on
pptp_srvr.  There, in the pppd messages, you will find
</p>
<p>
<b>Cannot determine ethernet address for proxy ARP</b>
</p>
<p>

This is due to an issue with the pppd program, which attempts to find a
hardware interface on the subnet to which the pppd client has been
assigned.  In this case its looking for a hardware interface on the
192.168.5.0 subnet.  It will fail to find one, and will drop the
proxyarp request.
</p>
<p>

The simplest way around this problem, and the one that is suggested in
the pppd documentation, is to set the pppd client IP assignment to be on
the local subnet.  An example in this case might be 192.168.56.129.
However, it may not be possible to do that.  In the case of a fully
loaded subnet, there may not be any addresses to spare.  Or there may be
some security issues with giving out local subnet addresses.  What to
do?
</p>
<p>

The place to look is in the arp table.  If you run tcpdump on host
(192.168.56.12) during the time when client is pinging, you will see
unanswered arp requests from host attempting to find the hardware
address for 192.168.5.12.  You need to proxy the hardware address of the
pptp_srvr for client in order for this request to be fulfilled.  This is
the job of proxyarp.  However, proxyarp has let us down in this
instance, and we need to find a workaround.
</p>
<p>

This can be done manually using the arp command on pptp_srvr.  For
example, if the hardware address of the ethernet card on pptp_srvr is
00:60:08:98:14:14, you could force the arp to proxy the client pptp
address by saying
</p><pre>	arp --set 192.168.5.12 00:60:08:98:14:13 pub
</pre><p>

You should now be able to ping from client to host through the pptp
connection.
</p>
<p>

This can be a problem, however, in a dynamic environment when clients
are logging into and out of the pptp server on a continuous basis.  One
way around this problem is to write a script that will execute upon the
initiation of each ppp connection.
</p>
<p>

The place to do this is in /etc/ppp/ip-up.  This script is executed each
time a new ppp connection is started.  It gets some variables passed
into it, one of which is the assigned IP address of the client.  Note
that RedHat systems use ip-up.local as the place for you to make the
script.  Don't forget to chmod +x !
</p><pre>#! /bin/bash

REMOTE_IP_ADDRESS=$5

date &gt; /var/run/ppp.up
echo "REMOTE_IP_ADDRESS = " $REMOTE_IP_ADDRESS &gt;&gt; /var/run/ppp.up
arp --set $REMOTE_IP_ADDRESS 00:60:08:98:14:14 pub &gt;&gt; /var/run/ppp.up

exit 0
</pre>
<p>

This should put you in business for accessing the remote subnet under
this scenario.  I am a little bit concerned, however, because I also
built a script ip-down.local, that should remove the arp proxy when
client disconnected.  It doesn't seem to do anything, however, and if I
try to delete the arp entry manually, it just spits out a cryptic error
message.  The arp entries remain persistent, as far as I can tell.  If
this is a problem or not, I don't know.  The next few clients that log
in are treated well, so I guess its OK.

Also, after running pptpd and monitoring its log file and seeing that it
failed to open ttyp1 - I chmod +rw /dev/ttyp[0-9] and it seemed to work
somewhat.  But, after I rebooted, I had to do this again.  Is this normal?
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i><font size="+2">A.</font></i>
pptpd should be running as root (unless you have a system with a setuid 
openpty() helper, which isn't very common).  If it fails to open a pty/tty
pair as root then that is probably because it is in use.
</p>
<p>

Other programs which use pty/tty's will change their permissions back to
the standard ones.

<p>
<i><font size="+2">A.</font></i>
Yeah, in your /lib/modules/`uname -r`/net/ directory, there should
be files called bsd_comp.o and ppp_deflate.o.. insmod those files and
you'll be good to go.

Hi, I'm having trouble getting pptpd & mschap-v2 to work. I downloaded
all of the patches and compiled everything but whenever i try to connect, it says:
</i></p>
<p><i><b>

Error 691:  The computer you have dialed in to has denied access because
the username and/or password is invalid on the domain.
</b></i></p>
<p>
<i>What is this suppose to mean?
</i></p><i></i>
<i><font size="+2">A.</font></i>
Error 691 is an authentication problem probably due to the fact that MS
chap uses the domain name and username combo to authenticate.  If you
look at the logs you will probably see a message saying that MS chap is
trying to authenticate user "domain\\username".  I got it to work by
putting the full domain and user string in the client portion of the
chap-secrets file.
<pre># Secrets for authentication using CHAP
# client                server          secret          IP addresses
workgroup\\user         server          password        *    
</pre>
<p>

There is also a patch called chapms-strip-domain out there which strips off the domain.

How do I go about checking who is logged in via tunnel?
</i></p>
<p>
<i>I need some way of writing the pppd data to wtmp/utmp.

</i></p>
<p>
<i>does anyone know of any way of doing this via ppp?
</i></p>
<p><i><font size="+2">A.</font></i>
You will find a pptpd-logwtmp plugin in pptpd version 1.2.1 and later,
which if enabled will maintain the /var/log/wtmp file so that
<i>who</i> and <i>last</i> will show you the logins.
</p><p>


Alternatively, 
pppd syslogs everything to /var/log/messages (that's the default on my box
anyways) and it will say something like :
</p><pre>	pppd[15450]: CHAP peer authentication succeeded for <username>
</username></pre>
<p>

you could do a tail /var/log/messages -n2000 | grep CHAP if you wanted to
see who has been logging in.
</p>
<p>

All the authentication is
provided by pppd (if you don't have an auth or a require-chap or pap, etc.)
option, it doesn't even ask for a username.

<p><i><font size="+2">Q.</font>
How many clients does Poptop support?
</i></p>
<p>
<i><font size="+2">A.</font></i>
The limits under Linux are:
</p><p>
</p><ol><ul>
	<li>per-process filedescriptors
	<ul><li>one per client (would limit clients to 256 by default,
	or 1024 with kernel recompile, or more with major libc/kernel
	hackery)</li></ul></li>
       <ul><li>no relevant limit</li></ul>

<li>ttys
	<ul><li>currently, with a standard kernel, 256 clients</li></ul></li>
        <ul><li>with Unix98 ptys and a small amount of coding, 2048</li></ul>

<li>ppp devices
	<ul><li>no limit in kernel source for ppp</li></ul></li>

<li>processes
        <ul><li>2 per client plus system processes</li></ul></li>
<p>

So it seems that 2048 will be the limit, if you fix a few things and
with a minor kernel mod.  To go above 2048 the easiest approach would
be to combine pptpctrl and pppd in one process, which would get you to
4096.  Beyond there, you need to go for a select() based model, which would
be significant coding effort and require large fd-set sizes and so on.
So 4096 is the practical limit, and 2048 the easy limit.

<p><i><font size="+2">Q.</font>
What authentication methods (PAP/CHAP) does Poptop work with?
</i></p>
<p>
<i><font size="+2">A.</font></i>
Poptop uses whatever authentication methods your PPPd provides (usually
PAP, CHAP, MSCHAP and MSCHAPv2).  To use MPPE, MSCHAPv2 is required.
</p>

When running Poptop I get the following error:
<pre>Jun 11 08:29:04 server pptpd[4875]: MGR: No more free connection slots!
</pre> 
What does this mean?
</i></p>
<p>
<i><font size="+2">A.</font></i>
I'd say at a guess you've only configured one IP address and you have 
connected a client, and as such there are no more free connection slots should 
any more clients wish to connect.

<a name="12"></a>
<p><i><font size="+2">Q.</font>
Does Poptop suffer from the same security flaws
(<a href="http://www.counterpane.com/pptp.html">http://www.counterpane.com/pptp.html</a>)
as the Windows NT PPTP server?
</i></p>
<p>
<i><font size="+2">A.</font></i>
An initial look at the article suggests that what the authors hammered was
not the PPTP protocol, but the authentication that the PPTP VPN servers on
NT offered access to via open internet.  PPTP seems initially to be just
the path to the weakness, not the weakness itself.  Part of their
observance of weakness deals with use of poor passwords as well, a cheap
component, simple enough to fix.
</p>
<p>

&gt; While no flaws were found in PPTP itself, several serious flaws were<br>
&gt; found in the Microsoft implementation of it.<br>
&gt; (<a href="http://www.counterpane.com/pptp-pressrel.html">http://www.counterpane.com/pptp-pressrel.html</a>)<br>
</p>
<p>

The authors do not specifically say "this is ONLY effective against NT",
just that NT is affected.  This implies that they do not recognize Poptop,
and it may be included.  The fact that Poptop has to interOp with MS DUN's
VPN client means that it will have the same weaknesses.  It can only
protect itself from DoS attacks, have immediate response to out-of-sequence
packets or illogical packets, etc.
</p>
<p>

The protocol is not considered weak in this analysis, but the weaknesses
have to be replicated in apparent behavior by Poptop.  The only thing the
developers can do with Poptop is make it a stronger server per se -- more
able to handle the attacks when the come.
</p>
<p>

In conclusion: Poptop suffers the same security vulnerabilities as the NT
sever (this is because it operates with Windows clients).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Update: MSCHAPv2 has been released and addresses some of the security
issues. Poptop works with MSCHAPv2, which is implemented in pppd.</strong>

<a name="13"></a>
<p><i><font size="+2">Q.</font>
Does Poptop support data encryption?
</i></p>
<p>
<i><font size="+2">A.</font></i>
Yes, in that it uses PPP for it.  PPP 2.4.2 or later contains support
for MPPE, and you may need to use the ppp_mppe.o kernel module
provided by the PPP project.  This module was merged with kernel
sources from 2.6.15-rc1.  See the <a href="http://pptpclient.sourceforge.net/">PPTP Client Project</a> for
generic and specific instructions on adding MPPE support to kernels
below 2.6.15-rc1.

<p><i><font size="+2">Q.</font>
Poptop or IPsec? Which is better suited to my needs?
</i></p>
<p>
<i><font size="+2">A.</font></i>
Here are some reasons I can think of:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The difference between Poptop and IPsec is that Poptop is ready NOW..
and requires *no* third party software on the Windows client end
(Windows comes with a free PPTP client that is trivial to set up).
</p></li>
<li>Poptop is a completely *free* solution.
Update: Unfortunately not true for Mac *clients* before Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar) though. 
The Mac client software is around $400 US a copy.
</li>
<li><p>

Poptop can be integrated with the latest PPPD patches that take
advantage of MSCHAPv2 and MPPE (Microsoft encryption using RC4 - 40/128
bits).

<p>
<font size="-1">Neither network layer-based (L2TP, PPTP,...) nor application layer-based
(IPSec,SSL,SSH) security techniques are the best choice for all
situations. There will be trade-offs. Network layer security protects the
information created by upper layer protocols, but it requires that IPSec
be implemented in the communications stack.
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="-1">With network layer security, there is no need to modify existing upper
layer applications. On the other hand, if security features are already
imbedded within a given application, then the data for that specific
application will be protected while it is in transit, even in the absence
of network layer security. Therefore security functions must be imbedded
on a per-application basis.
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="-1">There are still other considerations:
Authentication is provided only for the identity of tunnel endpoints, but
not for each individual packet that flows inside the tunnel. This can
expose the tunnel to man-in-the-middle and spoofing attacks.
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="-1">Network layer security gives blanket protection, but this may not be as
fine-grained as would be desired for a given application. It protects
all traffic and is transparent to users and applications.
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="-1">Network layer security does not provide protection once the datagram has
arrived at its destination host. That is, it is vulnerable to attack
within the upper layers of the protocol stack at the destination machine.
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="-1">Application layer security can protect the information that has been
generated within the upper layers of the stack, but it offers no
protection against several common network layer attacks while the
datagram is in transit. For example, a datagram in transit would be
vulnerable to spoofing attacks against its source or destination address.
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="-1">Application layer security is more intelligent (as it knows the
application) but also more complex and slower.
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="-1">IPSec provides for tunnel authentication, while PPTP does not.
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="-1"><b>User Authentication</b></font></p><p><font size="-1"> Layer 2 tunneling protocols inherit the user
authentication schemes of PPP, including the EAP methods discussed below.
Many Layer 3 tunneling schemes assume that the endpoints were well
known (and authenticated) before the tunnel was established. An exception
to this is IPSec ISAKMP negotiation, which provides mutual authentication
of the tunnel endpoints. (Note that most IPSec implementations support
machine-based certificates only, rather than user certificates. As a
result, any user with access to one of the endpoint machines can use
the tunnel. This potential security weakness can be eliminated when
IPSec is paired with a Layer 2 protocol such as L2TP.
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="-1"><b>Token card support</b></font></p><p><font size="-1"> Using the Extensible Authentication Protocol
(EAP), Layer 2 tunneling protocols can support a wide variety of
authentication methods, including one-time passwords, cryptographic
calculators, and smart cards. Layer 3 tunneling protocols (IPSec) can
use similar methods; for example, IPSec defines public key certificate
authentication in its ISAKMP/Oakley negotiation.

<font size="-1"><b>Data Compression</b></font></p><p><font size="-1"> Layer 2 tunneling protocols support PPP-based

<font size="-1"><b>Data Encryption</b></font></p><p><font size="-1"> Layer 2 tunneling protocols support PPP-based data
encryption mechanisms. Microsoft's implementation of PPTP supports
optional use of Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE), based on
the RSA/RC4 algorithm. Layer 3 tunneling protocols can use similar
methods; for example, IPSec defines several optional data encryption
methods which are negotiated during the ISAKMP/Oakley exchange.

<p>
<font size="-1"><b>Key Management</b></font></p><p><font size="-1"> MPPE, a Layer 2 protocol, relies on the initial key

<p>
<font size="-1"><b>Multi-protocol support</b></font></p><p><font size="-1"> Layer 2 tunneling supports multiple payload
protocols, which makes it easy for tunneling clients to access their
corporate networks using IP, IPX, NetBEUI, and so forth. In contrast,
Layer 3 tunneling protocols, such as IPSec tunnel mode, typically
support only target networks that use the IP protocol. IPSec is not
multi-protocol.

<p>
<font size="-1">IPSec will be suported by Windows 2000.

<p>
<font size="-1">Many cases can occur, each of which needs to be examined on its own 
merit. It may be desirable to employ a mix of both network layer
security techniques and application layer techniques to achieve the
desired overall level of protection. For example, you could use an upper
layer mechanism such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt upper
layer data. SSL could then be supplemented with IPSec's AH protocol at
the network layer to provide per-packet data origin authentication and
protection against spoofing attacks.

PPTP uses protocol GRE (47) for it's tunnel. When two clients behind a single NAT firewall 
connect to the same PPTP server, their source IP address will be rewritten by their firewall. 
In this case, the GRE sockets in two pptpctrl processes will be reading GRE packets from both 
clients.  The only way to distinguish between those two clients is to filter them by destination 
call ID number found in the GRE header. In order for the client NAT firewall to correctly rewrite 
the PPTP server's replies, please check Philip Craig's netfilter pptp helper module available from the 
Netfilter CVS server:<br>
cvs -d :pserver:cvs@pserver.netfilter.org:/cvspublic login<br>

How do I set up authentication against LDAP?
</i></p>
<p>
<i><font size="+2">A.</font></i>
You can go about this two ways:<br>
</p><ol>
<li>Use the Radius plugin in pppd (=&gt; v2.4.2) and set up a radiusserver
</li><li>Patch pppd with a ldap patch, compile and set chap-secrets to:<br>
* pptpd &uid?(morrisonvpnaccess=Y)(objectclass=posixAccount)?ou=People,o=Morrison\ Industries,c=US *<br>
</li></ol>
This uses the first "?" delimited value as the key to lookup the user's object. The second parameter is any additional filters you wish to apply. The third parameter is the search base. So if "fred" attempts to establish a VPN connection PPPD will attempt to get the "ntpassword" attribute from the first object matching "(&(uid=fred)(morrisonvpnaccess=Y)(objectclass=posixAccount))" beneath "ou=People,o=Morrison\ Industries,c=US". The only hardcoded value is the name of the ldap server, which is hardcoded to "ldap". 
<br><br>
For more details (and patched pppd) go to <a href="http://www.kalamazoolinux.org/projects/awilliam/ldap.html" target="_new">http://www.kalamazoolinux.org/projects/awilliam/ldap.html</a>. The user who reported this had to modify auth.c to fit to the LDAP server.

Windows XP clients do not work.

There are two similar things that seem to affect winXP pro:
<br><br>
1) VPN disconnects after about 1 min : Happens on systems with internet connection sharing enabled on the active non-vpn (eg dialup) network connection.  Resolve by not sharing.<br><br>
2) VPN disconnects after about 5 mins: Happens on some winXP pro systems.  Call MS to obtain a patch, because it's not been fully tested yet - will be addressed in SP2.<br>
</p><hr width="50%" noshade="noshade">
2-Apr-2003:<br>
A 'vpn' patch will be present in XP SP2, but no details of exactly what the patch fixes. Could be that it will fix all these problems.
8-Apr-2003:<br>
User comment: I upgraded XP to SP1 level....and now it works!

The log will display something like this:<br>
<br>
Jun 22 21:48:35 linuxbox pptpd[1900]: GRE: read(fd=5,buffer=804d720,len=8196) from PTY failed: status = -1 error = Input/output error<br>
Jun 22 21:48:35 linuxbox pptpd[1900]: CTRL: PTY read or GRE write failed (pty,gre)=(5,6)<br>
<br>
pppd failed for some reason. pptpd failed to report why pppd failed. 
This is a bug, but it is not yet fixed.<br>
You should look at why pppd failed, which is most likely your fault, not
a bug. pppd fails when it does not understand the options you entered.
Running pppd manually against your options.pptpd file would find the bad
options.

It helps PPTP performance quite a bit if you use a WINS server.<br>

Why are there Out Of Order drops of fragmented packages?
</i></p>
<p>
<i><font size="+2">A.</font></i>
Microsoft Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) discards all packets that are received out of sequence. 
This is likely to happen over networks, such as the Internet, where multiple packets may take different 
routes to a common destination.<br>

<p><i><font size="+2">Q.</font>
What are these version numbers on PPP packages?
</i></p>
<p>

On the project file list, there are a number of different versions of
ppp-2.4.3, e.g. ppp-2.4.3-0.cvs_20040527.X.i386.rpm where X can have
the value 1, 2, 4 and 6.  What is the difference between these
versions?</p>
<p>
<i><font size="+2">A.</font></i>
They are packaging versions.
</p><p>

Changes in these version numbers represent
changes in packaging, which is the translation from .tar.gz to .rpm.
They represent changes made by the packager, not changes made to the
upstream version.
</p><p>

So in the string ppp-2.4.3-0.cvs_20040527.X.i386.rpm, this is version
2.4.3 of PPP cut from PPP CVS as of 2004-05-27, and has been revised X
times by the packager.
</p><p>

Usually packaging changes represent packaging issues; changes of how the
package is built or installed into the filesystem.  Sometimes a patch
may be included, to increase compatibility with the target distribution,
or to fix an urgent problem without grabbing a whole new upstream
version.
</p><p>

Why do we keep the old ones around?  Sometimes people ask for them.
Some of the HOWTOs and instructions make reference to a specific
version, and were tested with that version.  It's helpful to the end
user to know which particular package version a HOWTO was written from.
(Although that mainly affects the PPTP client side of things, the client
project uses the PPP packages from the PPTP server project.)
</p><p>

So we would expect you to use just one RPM for a system.
</p><p>

Raymond's <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-Release-Practice-HOWTO/">Software
Release Practice HOWTO</a>.
