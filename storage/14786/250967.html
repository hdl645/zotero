           <p>September 21, 2007</p>
           <p>This article was contributed by  Ulrich Drepper</p>
           </div>
           [<i>Editor's introduction: Ulrich Drepper recently approached us asking if
we would be interested in publishing a lengthy document he had written on
how memory and software interact.  We did not have to look at the text for
long to realize that it would be of interest to many LWN readers.  Memory
usage is often the determining factor in how software performs, but good
information on how to avoid memory bottlenecks is hard to find.  This
series of articles should change that situation.
</i><p>
<i>The original document prints out at over 100 pages.  We will be splitting
it into about seven segments, each run 1-2 weeks after its predecessor.
Once the entire series is out, Ulrich will be releasing the full text.
</i></p><p>
<i>Reformatting the text from the original LaTeX has been a bit of a
challenge, but the results, hopefully, will be good.  For ease of online
reading, Ulrich's footnotes have been placed {inline in the text}.
Hyperlinked cross-references (and [bibliography references]) will not be
possible until the full series is published.
</i></p><p>
<i>Many thanks to Ulrich for allowing LWN to publish this material; we hope
that it will lead to more memory-efficient software across our systems in
the near future.</i>]
</p><p>


</p><h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p>

In the early days computers were much simpler.  The various components
of a system, such as the CPU, memory, mass storage, and network
interfaces, were developed together and, as a result, were quite
balanced in their performance.  For example, the memory and network
interfaces were not (much) faster than the CPU at providing data.
<!--  XXX express speed is about the same -->
</p><p>

This situation changed once the basic structure of computers
stabilized and hardware developers concentrated on optimizing
individual subsystems.  Suddenly the performance of some components of
the computer fell significantly behind and bottlenecks developed.
This was especially true for mass storage and memory subsystems which,
for cost reasons, improved more slowly relative to other components.
</p><p>

The slowness of mass storage has mostly been dealt with using software
techniques: operating systems keep most often used (and most likely to
be used) data in main memory, which can be accessed at a rate orders of
magnitude faster than the hard disk.  Cache storage was added to the
storage devices themselves, which requires no changes in the operating system to
increase performance.  {<i>Changes are needed, however, to
guarantee data integrity when using storage device caches.</i>}  For the
purposes of this paper, we will not go into more details of software
optimizations for the mass storage access.
</p><p>

Unlike storage subsystems, removing the main memory as a bottleneck
has proven much more difficult and almost all solutions require changes to
the hardware.  Today these changes mainly come in the following forms:
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<p>
</p><li> RAM hardware design (speed and parallelism).
<p>
</p></li><li> Memory controller designs.
<p>
</p></li><li> CPU caches.
<p>
</p></li><li> Direct memory access (DMA) for devices.
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>

For the most part, this document will deal with CPU caches and some
effects of memory controller design.  In the process of exploring
these topics, we will explore DMA and bring it into the larger
picture.  However, we will start with an overview of the design for
today's commodity hardware.  This is a prerequisite to understanding
the problems and the limitations of efficiently using memory
subsystems.  We will also learn about, in some detail, the different types
of RAM and illustrate why these differences still exist.
</p><p>

This document is in no way all inclusive and final.  It is limited to
commodity hardware and further limited to a subset of that hardware.
Also, many topics will be discussed in just enough detail
for the goals of this paper.  For such topics, readers are recommended to
find more detailed documentation.
</p><p>

When it comes to operating-system-specific details and solutions,
the text exclusively
describes Linux.  At no time will it contain any information about
other OSes.  The author has no interest in discussing the implications
for other OSes.  If the reader thinks s/he has to use a different OS
they have to go to their vendors and demand they write documents
similar to this one.
</p><p>

One last comment before the start.  The text contains a number of
occurrences of the term &ldquo;usually&rdquo; and other, similar qualifiers.
The technology discussed here exists in many, many
variations in the real world and this paper only addresses the most
common, mainstream versions.  It is rare that absolute statements can be
made about this technology, thus the qualifiers.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h3>1.1 Document Structure</h3>
<p>

This document is mostly for software developers.  It does not go into
enough technical details of the hardware to be useful for
hardware-oriented readers.  But before we can go into the practical
information for developers a lot of groundwork must be laid.
</p><p>

To that end, the second section describes random-access memory (RAM) in
technical detail.  This
section's content is nice to know but not absolutely critical to be able to
understand the later sections.  Appropriate back references to the
section are added in places where the content is required so that the
anxious reader could skip most of this section at first.
</p><p>

The third section goes into a lot of details of CPU cache behavior.
Graphs have been used to keep the text from being as dry as it would otherwise
be.  This content is essential for an understanding of the rest of the document.
Section&nbsp;4 describes briefly how virtual memory is implemented.  This
is also required groundwork for the rest.
</p><p>

Section 5 goes into a lot of detail about Non Uniform Memory
Access (NUMA) systems.
</p><p>

Section 6 is the central section of this paper.  It brings together
all the previous sections' information and gives programmers advice on
how to write code which performs well in the various situations.  The
very impatient reader could start with this section and, if necessary, go
back to the earlier sections to freshen up the knowledge of the
underlying technology.
</p><p>

Section 7 introduces tools which can help the programmer do a
better job.  Even with a complete understanding of the technology it
is far from obvious where in a non-trivial software project the
problems are.  Some tools are necessary.
</p><p>

In section 8 we finally give an outlook of technology which can be
expected in the near future or which might just simply be good to have.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h3>1.2 Reporting Problems</h3>
<p>

The author intends to update this document for some time.  This
includes updates made necessary by advances in technology but also to
correct mistakes.  Readers willing to report problems are encouraged
to send email.  
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h3>1.3 Thanks</h3>
<p>

I would like to thank Johnray Fuller and especially Jonathan Corbet 
for taking on part of the
daunting task of transforming the author's form of English into something
more traditional.  Markus Armbruster provided a lot of valuable input
on problems and omissions in the text.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h3>1.4 About this Document</h3>
<p>

The title of this paper is an homage to David Goldberg's classic paper
&ldquo;What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point
Arithmetic&rdquo; [goldberg].  Goldberg's paper is still not widely
known, although it should be a prerequisite for anybody daring to
touch a keyboard for serious programming.
</p><p>
</p><h2>2 Commodity Hardware Today</h2>

<p>

Understanding commodity hardware is important because specialized
hardware is in retreat.  Scaling these days is most often achieved
horizontally instead of vertically, meaning today it is more cost-effective
to use many smaller, connected commodity computers
instead of a few really large and exceptionally fast (and expensive)
systems.  This is the case because fast and inexpensive network
hardware is widely available.  There are still situations where the
large specialized systems have their place and these systems still
provide a business opportunity, but the overall market is dwarfed by
the commodity hardware market.  Red Hat, as of 2007, expects that for
future products, the &ldquo;standard building blocks&rdquo; for most data
centers will be a computer with up to four sockets, each filled with a
quad core CPU that, in the case of Intel CPUs, will be
hyper-threaded. {<i>Hyper-threading enables a single processor
  core to be used for two or more concurrent executions with just a
  little extra hardware.</i>}  This means the standard system in the data
center will have up to 64 virtual processors.  Bigger machines will be
supported, but the quad socket, quad CPU core case is currently
thought to be the sweet spot and most optimizations are targeted for
such machines.
</p><p>

Large differences exist in the structure of commodity computers.  That
said, we will cover more than 90% of such hardware by concentrating
on the most important differences.  Note that these technical details
tend to change rapidly, so the reader is advised to take the date
of this writing into account.
</p><p>
</p><p>

Over the years the personal computers and smaller servers standardized
on a chipset with two parts: the Northbridge and Southbridge.
Figure 2.1 shows this structure.
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<img src="cpumemory.4.png">
<p><b>Figure 2.1: Structure with Northbridge and Southbridge</b>

</p></blockquote>
<p>

All CPUs (two in the previous example, but there can be more) are
connected via a common bus (the Front Side Bus, FSB) to the
Northbridge.  The Northbridge contains, among other things, the memory
controller, and its implementation determines the type of RAM chips
used for the computer.  Different types of RAM, such as DRAM, Rambus,
and SDRAM, require different memory controllers.
</p><p>

To reach all other system devices, the Northbridge must communicate with
the Southbridge.  The Southbridge, often referred to as the I/O
bridge, handles communication with devices through a variety of
different buses.  Today the PCI, PCI Express, SATA, and USB buses are
of most importance, but PATA, IEEE&nbsp;1394, serial, and parallel ports
are also supported by the Southbridge.  Older systems had AGP slots
which were attached to the Northbridge.  This was done for performance
reasons related to insufficiently fast connections between the
Northbridge and Southbridge.  However, today the PCI-E slots are all
connected to the Southbridge.
</p><p>

Such a system structure has a number of noteworthy consequences:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<p>
</p><li> All data communication from one CPU to another must travel over
  the same bus used to communicate with the Northbridge.
<p>
</p></li><li> All communication with RAM must pass through the Northbridge.
<p>
</p></li><li> The RAM has only a single port.
{<i>We will not discuss multi-port RAM in this document as this
type of RAM is not found in commodity hardware, at least not in places
where the programmer has access to it.  It can be found in specialized
hardware such as network routers which depend on utmost speed.</i>}
<p>
</p></li><li> Communication between a CPU and a device attached to the
  Southbridge is routed through the Northbridge.
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>

A couple of bottlenecks are immediately apparent in this design.  One
such bottleneck involves access to RAM for devices. In the earliest
days of the PC, all communication with devices on either bridge had to
pass through the CPU, negatively impacting overall system performance.
To work around this problem some devices became capable of direct
memory access (DMA). DMA allows devices, with the help of the
Northbridge, to store and receive data in RAM directly without the
intervention of the CPU (and its inherent performance cost).  Today all
high-performance devices attached to any of the buses can utilize DMA.
While this greatly reduces the workload on the CPU, it also creates
contention for the bandwidth of the Northbridge as DMA requests
compete with RAM access from the CPUs.  This problem, therefore, must
to be taken into account.
</p><p>

A second bottleneck involves the bus from the Northbridge to the RAM.
The exact details of the bus depend on the memory types deployed.
On older systems there is only one bus to all the RAM chips, so
parallel access is not possible.  Recent RAM types require
two separate buses (or channels as they are called for DDR2,
see Figure 2.8) which doubles the available bandwidth.  The
Northbridge interleaves memory access across the channels.  More
recent memory technologies (FB-DRAM, for instance) add more channels.
</p><p>
</p><p>

With limited bandwidth available, it is important to schedule memory
access in ways that minimize delays.  As we will see, processors are much faster and
must wait to access memory, despite the use of CPU caches.  If multiple
hyper-threads, cores, or processors access memory at the same time,
the wait times for memory access are even longer.  This is also true
for DMA operations.
</p><p>

There is more to accessing memory than
concurrency, however.  Access patterns themselves also greatly
influence the performance of the memory subsystem, especially with
multiple memory channels. Refer to Section 2.2 for more
details of RAM access patterns.
</p><p>

On some more expensive systems, the Northbridge does not actually
contain the memory controller.  Instead the Northbridge can be
connected to a number of external memory controllers (in the following
example, four of them).
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<img src="cpumemory.5.png">
<p><b>Figure 2.2: Northbridge with External Controllers</b>

</p></blockquote>
<p>

The advantage of this architecture is that more than one memory bus
exists and therefore total bandwidth increases.  This design also
supports more memory.  Concurrent memory access patterns reduce delays
by simultaneously accessing different memory banks.  This is
especially true when multiple processors are directly connected to
the Northbridge, as in Figure 2.2.  For such a design, the
primary limitation is the internal bandwidth of the Northbridge, which
is phenomenal for this architecture (from Intel).  {<i>For
completeness it should be mentioned that such a memory controller
arrangement can be used for other purposes such as &ldquo;memory RAID&rdquo;
which is useful in combination with hotplug memory.</i>}
</p><p>

Using multiple external memory controllers is not the only way to
increase memory bandwidth.  One other increasingly popular way is to integrate
memory controllers into the CPUs and attach memory to each CPU.  This
architecture is made popular by SMP systems based on AMD's Opteron
processor.  Figure 2.3 shows such a system.  Intel will have
support for the Common System Interface (CSI) starting with the
Nehalem processors; this is basically the same approach: an integrated
memory controller with the possibility of local memory for each
processor.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<img src="cpumemory.6.png">
<p><b>Figure 2.3: Integrated Memory Controller</b>

</p></blockquote>
<p>

With an architecture like this there are as many memory banks
available as there are processors.  On a quad-CPU machine the memory
bandwidth is quadrupled without the need for a complicated Northbridge with
enormous bandwidth.  Having a memory controller integrated into the
CPU has some additional advantages; we will not dig deeper into this
technology here.
</p><p>

There are disadvantages to this architecture, too.  First of all,
because the machine still has to make all the memory of the system
accessible to all processors, the memory is not uniform anymore (hence
the name NUMA - Non-Uniform Memory Architecture - for such an architecture).
Local memory (memory attached to a processor)
can be accessed with the usual speed.  The situation is different when
memory attached to another processor is accessed.  In this case
the interconnects between the processors have to be used.  To access
memory attached to CPU<sub>2</sub> from CPU<sub>1</sub> requires communication across one
interconnect. When the same CPU accesses memory attached to
CPU<sub>4</sub> two interconnects have to be crossed.
</p><p>

Each such communication has an associated cost.  We talk about &ldquo;NUMA
factors&rdquo; when we describe the extra time needed to access remote
memory.  The example architecture in Figure 2.3 has two
levels for each CPU:  immediately adjacent CPUs and one CPU
which is two interconnects away.  With more
complicated machines the number of levels can grow significantly.  There are
also machine architectures (for instance IBM's x445 and SGI's
Altix series) where there is more than one type of connection.  CPUs
are organized into nodes; within a node the time to access the
memory might be uniform or have only small NUMA factors.  The
connection between nodes can be very expensive, though, and the NUMA
factor can be quite high.
</p><p>

Commodity NUMA machines exist today and will likely play an even greater
role in the future.  It is expected that, from late 2008 on, every SMP
machine will use NUMA.  The costs associated with NUMA make it important to
recognize when a program is running on a NUMA machine.  In
Section 5 we will discuss more machine architectures and some
technologies the Linux kernel provides for these programs.
</p><p>

Beyond the technical details described in the remainder of this
section, there are several additional factors which influence the
performance of RAM.  They are not controllable by software, which is
why they are not covered in this section.  The interested reader can
learn about some of these factors in Section 2.1.  They are really
only needed to get a more complete picture of RAM technology and
possibly to make better decisions when purchasing computers.
</p><p>

The following two sections discuss hardware details at the gate level
and the access protocol between the memory controller and the DRAM
chips.  Programmers will likely find this information enlightening since these
details explain why RAM access works the way it does.  It is optional
knowledge, though, and the reader anxious to get to topics with more
immediate relevance for everyday life can jump ahead to
Section 2.2.5.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h3>2.1 RAM Types</h3>

<p>

There have been many types of RAM over the years and each type
varies, sometimes significantly, from the other.  The older types are
today really only interesting to the historians.  We will not explore
the details of those.  Instead we will concentrate on modern RAM types;
we will only scrape the surface, exploring some details which are
visible to the kernel or application developer through their
performance characteristics.
</p><p>

The first interesting details are centered around the question why
there are different types of RAM in the same machine.  More
specifically, why there are both static RAM (SRAM {<i>In other contexts
SRAM might mean &ldquo;synchronous RAM&rdquo;.</i>}) and dynamic RAM (DRAM).  The
former is much faster and provides the same functionality.  Why is not
all RAM in a machine SRAM?  The answer is, as one might expect, cost.
SRAM is much more expensive to produce and to use than DRAM.  Both
these cost factors are important, the second one increasing in
importance more and more.  To understand these difference we look at
the implementation of a bit of storage for both SRAM and DRAM.
</p><p>

In the remainder of this section we will discuss some low-level
details of the implementation of RAM.  We will keep the level of detail as
low as possible.  To that end, we will discuss the signals at a &ldquo;logic level&rdquo; and not at
a level a hardware designer would have to use.  That level of detail
is unnecessary for our purpose here.
</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>2.1.1 Static RAM</b>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<img src="cpumemory.7.png">
<p><b>Figure 2.4: 6-T Static RAM</b>

</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>

Figure 2.4 shows the structure of a 6&nbsp;transistor SRAM cell.
The core of this cell is formed by the four transistors <span class="UliMath">M<sub>1</sub></span>
to <span class="UliMath">M<sub>4</sub></span> which form two cross-coupled inverters.  They have
two stable states, representing 0 and 1 respectively.  The state is
stable as long as power on <span class="UliMath">V<sub>dd</sub></span> is available.
</p><p>

If access to the state of the cell is needed the word access line
<span class="UliMath">WL</span> is raised.  This makes the state of the cell immediately
available for reading on <span class="UliMath">BL</span> and
<span class="UliMath"><span class="UliInvSig">BL</span></span>.  If the cell state must be
overwritten the <span class="UliMath">BL</span> and <span class="UliMath"><span class="UliInvSig">BL</span></span>
lines are first set to the desired values and then <span class="UliMath">WL</span> is
raised.  Since the outside drivers are stronger than the four
transistors (<span class="UliMath">M<sub>1</sub></span> through <span class="UliMath">M<sub>4</sub></span>) this
allows the old state to be overwritten.
</p><p>

See&nbsp;[sramwiki] for a more detailed description of the way the cell works.
For the following discussion it is important to note that
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<p>
</p><li> one cell requires six transistors.  There are variants with four
  transistors but they have disadvantages.
<p>
</p></li><li> maintaining the state of the cell requires constant power.
<p>
</p></li><li> the cell state is available for reading almost immediately once
  the word access line <span class="UliMath">WL</span> is raised.  The signal is as rectangular 
  (changing quickly between the two binary states) as
  other transistor-controlled signals.
<p>
</p></li><li> the cell state is stable, no refresh cycles are needed.
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>

There are other, slower and less power-hungry, SRAM forms available, but
those are not of interest here since we are looking at fast RAM.
These slow variants are mainly interesting because they can be more
easily used in a system than dynamic RAM because of their
simpler interface.
</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>2.1.2 Dynamic RAM</b>

</p><p>
</p><p>

Dynamic RAM is, in its structure, much simpler than static RAM.
Figure 2.5 shows the structure of a usual DRAM cell design.
All it consists of is one transistor and one capacitor.  This huge
difference in complexity of course means that it functions very differently
than static RAM.
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<img src="cpumemory.8.png">
<p><b>Figure 2.5: 1-T Dynamic RAM</b>

</p></blockquote>
<p>

A dynamic RAM cell keeps its state in the capacitor <span class="UliMath">C</span>.  The
transistor <span class="UliMath">M</span> is used to guard the access to the state.  To
read the state of the cell the access line <span class="UliMath">AL</span> is raised;
this either causes a current to flow on the data line <span class="UliMath">DL</span> or
not, depending on the charge in the capacitor.  To write to the cell the
data line <span class="UliMath">DL</span> is appropriately 
set and then <span class="UliMath">AL</span> is raised for a time long enough to charge or
drain the capacitor.
</p><p>

There are a number of complications with the design of dynamic RAM.
The use of a capacitor means that reading the cell discharges the
capacitor.  The procedure cannot be repeated indefinitely, the
capacitor must be recharged at some point.  Even worse, to accommodate
the huge number of cells (chips with 10<sup>9</sup> or more cells are now
common) the capacity to the capacitor must be low (in the femto-farad range
or lower).  A fully charged capacitor holds a few 10's of thousands of
electrons.  Even though the resistance of the capacitor is high (a
couple of tera-ohms) it only takes a short time for the capacity to
dissipate.  This problem is called &ldquo;leakage&rdquo;.
</p><p>

This leakage is why a DRAM cell must be constantly refreshed.  For most DRAM
chips these days this refresh must happen every 64ms.  During the refresh cycle no access to
the memory is possible.  For some workloads this overhead might stall
up to 50% of the memory accesses (see&nbsp;[highperfdram]).
</p><p>

A second problem resulting from the tiny charge is that the
information read from the cell is not directly usable.  The data line
must be connected to a sense amplifier which can distinguish between
a stored 0 or 1 over the whole range of charges which still have to
count as&nbsp;1.
</p><p>

A third problem is that charging and draining a capacitor is not
instantaneous.  The signals received by the sense amplifier are not
rectangular, so a conservative estimate as to when the output of the
cell is usable has to be used.  The formulas for charging and
discharging a capacitor are
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<img src="capcharge.png" alt="[Formulas]">
</blockquote>
<p>

This means it takes some time (determined by the capacity C and
resistance R) for the capacitor to be charged and discharged.  It also
means that the current which can be detected by the sense amplifiers
is not immediately available.  Figure 2.6 shows the charge and
discharge curves.  The X&mdash;axis is measured in units of RC (resistance
multiplied by capacitance) which is a unit of time.
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<img src="cpumemory.57.png">
<p><b>Figure 2.6: Capacitor Charge and Discharge Timing</b>

</p></blockquote>
<p>

Unlike the static RAM case where the output is immediately available when
the word access line is raised, it will always take a bit of time until the
capacitor discharges sufficiently.  This delay severely limits how fast
DRAM can be.
</p><p>

The simple approach has its advantages, too.  The main advantage is
size.  The chip real estate needed for one DRAM cell is many times
smaller than that of an SRAM cell.  The SRAM cells also need
individual power for the transistors maintaining the state.  The
structure of the DRAM cell is also simpler and more regular which
means packing many of them close together on a die is simpler.
</p><p>

Overall, the (quite dramatic) difference in cost wins.  Except in
specialized hardware &mdash; network routers, for example &mdash; we have to live with main memory
which is based on DRAM.  This has huge implications on the programmer
which we will discuss in the remainder of this paper.  But first we need
to look into a few more details of the actual use of DRAM cells.
</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>2.1.3 DRAM Access</b>
</p><p>

A program selects a memory location using a virtual address.  The
processor translates this into a physical address and finally the
memory controller selects the RAM chip corresponding to that address.  To
select the individual memory cell on the RAM chip, parts of the
physical address are passed on in the form of a number of address
lines.  
</p><p>

It would be completely impractical to address memory locations
individually from the memory controller: 4GB of RAM would require
2<sup>32</sup> address lines.
Instead the address is passed encoded as a binary number using a
smaller set of address lines.  The address passed to the DRAM chip
this way must be demultiplexed first.  A demultiplexer with <i>N</i>
address lines will have 2<sup><i>N</i></sup> output lines.  These output lines can be
used to select the memory cell.  Using this direct approach is no big
problem for chips with small capacities.
</p><p>

But if the number of cells grows this approach is not suitable
anymore.  A chip with 1Gbit
{<i>I hate those SI prefixes. For me
a giga-bit will always be 2<sup>30</sup> and not 10<sup>9</sup> bits.</i>} 
capacity
would need 30 address lines and 2<sup>30</sup> select lines.  The size of a
demultiplexer increases exponentially with the number of input lines
when speed is not to be sacrificed.  A demultiplexer for 30 address
lines needs a whole lot of chip real estate in addition to the
complexity (size and time) of the demultiplexer.  Even more
importantly, transmitting 30 impulses on the address lines
synchronously is much harder than transmitting &ldquo;only&rdquo; 15 impulses.
Fewer lines have to be laid out at exactly the same length or timed
appropriately.  {<i>Modern DRAM types like DDR3 can automatically
adjust the timing but there is a limit as to what can be tolerated.</i>}
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<img src="cpumemory.9.png">
<p><b>Figure 2.7: Dynamic RAM Schematic</b>

</p></blockquote>
<p>

Figure 2.7 shows a DRAM chip at a very high level.  The DRAM
cells are organized in rows and columns.  They could all be aligned in
one row but then the DRAM chip would need a huge demultiplexer.  With
the array approach the design can get by with one demultiplexer and
one multiplexer of half the size.  {<i>Multiplexers and
demultiplexers are equivalent and the multiplexer here needs to work
as a demultiplexer when writing.  So we will drop the differentiation
from now on.</i>}  This is a huge saving on all fronts.  In the example
the address lines 
<span class="UliMath">a<sub>0</sub></span> and
<span class="UliMath">a<sub>1</sub></span> through the <i>row address
selection</i> 
(<span class="UliInvSig">RAS</span>)
demultiplexer select the address lines of a whole row of cells.  When
reading, the content of all cells is thusly made available to the
<i>column address selection</i> 
(<span class="UliInvSig">CAS</span>)
{<i>The line over the name
indicates that the signal is negated</i>} multiplexer.  Based on the
address lines <span class="UliMath">a<sub>2</sub></span> and
<span class="UliMath">a<sub>3</sub></span> the content of one column is
then made available to the data pin of the DRAM chip.  This happens
many times in parallel on a number of DRAM chips to produce a total
number of bits corresponding to the width of the data bus.
</p><p>

For writing, the new cell value is put on the data bus and, when the
cell is selected using the <span class="UliInvSig">RAS</span> and <span class="UliInvSig">CAS</span>, it is stored in the cell.
A pretty straightforward design.  There are in reality &mdash; obviously &mdash; many
more complications.  There need to be specifications for how much delay there
is after the signal before the data will be available on the data bus for
reading.  The capacitors do not unload instantaneously, as described
in the previous section.  The signal from the cells is so weak that
it needs to be amplified.  For writing it must be specified how long
the data must be available on the bus after the <span class="UliInvSig">RAS</span> and <span class="UliInvSig">CAS</span> is
done to successfully store the new value in the cell (again, capacitors
do not fill or drain instantaneously).  These timing constants are
crucial for the performance of the DRAM chip.  We will talk about this
in the next section.
</p><p>

A secondary scalability problem is that having 30 address lines
connected to every RAM chip is not feasible either.  Pins of a chip
are a precious resources.  It is &ldquo;bad&rdquo; enough that the data must be
transferred as much as possible in parallel (e.g., in 64 bit batches).
The memory controller must be able to address each RAM module
(collection of RAM chips).  If parallel access to multiple RAM modules
is required for performance reasons and each RAM module requires its own
set of 30 or more address lines, then the memory controller needs to
have, for 8 RAM modules, a whopping 240+ pins only for the address
handling.
</p><p>

To counter these secondary scalability problems DRAM chips have, for a long
time, multiplexed the address itself.  That means the address is
transferred in two parts.  The first part consisting of address bits
<span class="UliMath">a<sub>0</sub></span> and
<span class="UliMath">a<sub>1</sub></span> in the example in
Figure 2.7) select the row.  This selection remains active
until revoked.  Then the second part, address bits
<span class="UliMath">a<sub>2</sub></span> and
<span class="UliMath">a<sub>3</sub></span>, select the column.  The
crucial difference is that only two external address lines are needed.
A few more lines are needed to indicate when the <span class="UliInvSig">RAS</span> and <span class="UliInvSig">CAS</span> signals
are available but this is a small price to pay for cutting the number
of address lines in half.  This address multiplexing brings its own
set of problems, though.  We will discuss them in Section 2.2.
</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>2.1.4 Conclusions</b>
</p><p>

Do not worry if the details in this section are a bit overwhelming.
The important things to take away from this section are:

</p><ul>
<p>
</p><li> there are reasons why not all memory is SRAM

</p></li></ul>
<p>

The following section will go into more details about the actual
process of accessing DRAM memory.  We are not going into more details
of accessing SRAM, which is usually directly addressed.  This happens
for speed and because the SRAM memory is limited in size.  SRAM is
currently used in CPU caches and on-die where the connections are small
and fully under control of the CPU designer.  CPU caches are a topic
which we discuss later but all we need to know is that SRAM cells have
a certain maximum speed which depends on the effort spent on the
SRAM.  The speed can vary from only slightly slower than the CPU core
to one or two orders of magnitude slower.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h3>2.2 DRAM Access Technical Details</h3>

<p>

In the section introducing DRAM we saw that DRAM chips multiplex the
addresses in order to save resources.  We also saw that accessing DRAM
cells takes time since the capacitors in those cells do not discharge instantaneously
to produce a stable signal; we also saw that DRAM cells must be
refreshed.  Now it is time to put this all together and see how all
these factors determine how the DRAM access has to happen.
</p><p>
</p><p>

We will concentrate on current technology; we will not discuss
asynchronous DRAM and its variants as they are simply not relevant
anymore.  Readers interested in this topic are referred to
[highperfdram] and [arstechtwo].  We will also not talk about
Rambus DRAM (RDRAM) even though 
the technology is not obsolete.  It is just not widely used for system
memory.  We will concentrate exclusively
on Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) and its successors Double Data Rate DRAM
(DDR).
</p><p>

Synchronous DRAM, as the name suggests, works relative to a time
source.  The memory controller provides a clock,  the frequency of
which determines the speed of the Front Side Bus (FSB) &mdash;
the memory controller interface used by the DRAM chips.  As of this writing,
frequencies of 800MHz, 1,066MHz, or even 1,333MHz are available with
higher frequencies (1,600MHz) being announced for the next generation.  This
does not mean the frequency used on the bus is actually this high.
Instead, today's buses are double- or quad-pumped, meaning that data is
transported two or four times per cycle.  Higher numbers sell so the
manufacturers like to advertise a quad-pumped 200MHz bus as an
&ldquo;effective&rdquo; 800MHz bus.
</p><p>

For SDRAM today each data transfer consists of 64 bits &mdash; 8 bytes.  The
transfer rate of the FSB is therefore 8 bytes multiplied by the effective
bus frequency (6.4GB/s for the quad-pumped 200MHz bus).  That sounds a
lot but it is the burst speed, the maximum speed which will never be
surpassed.  As we will see now the protocol for talking
to the RAM modules has a lot of downtime when no data can be transmitted.
It is exactly this downtime which we must understand and minimize to
achieve the best performance.
</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>2.2.1 Read Access Protocol</b>

</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<img src="cpumemory.10.png">
<p><b>Figure 2.8: SDRAM Read Access Timing</b>

</p></blockquote>
<p>

Figure 2.8 shows the activity on some of the connectors of
a DRAM module which happens in three differently colored phases.  As
usual, time flows from left to right.  A lot of details are left out.
Here we only talk about the bus clock, <span class="UliInvSig">RAS</span> and <span class="UliInvSig">CAS</span> signals, and
the address and data buses.  A read cycle begins with the memory
controller making the row address available on the address bus and
lowering the <span class="UliInvSig">RAS</span> signal.  All signals are read on the rising edge
of the clock (CLK) so it does not matter if the signal is not
completely square as long as it is stable at the time it is read.
Setting the row address causes the RAM chip to start latching the
addressed row.
</p><p>

The <span class="UliInvSig">CAS</span> signal can be sent after <span class="UliMath">t<sub>RCD</sub></span> (<span class="UliInvSig">RAS</span>-to-<span class="UliInvSig">CAS</span> Delay)
clock cycles.  The column address is then transmitted by making it
available on the address bus and lowering the <span class="UliInvSig">CAS</span> line.  Here we
can see how the two parts of the address (more or less halves, nothing
else makes sense) can be transmitted over the same address bus.
</p><p>

Now the addressing is complete and the data can be transmitted.  The
RAM chip needs some time to prepare for this.  The delay is usually
called <span class="UliInvSig">CAS</span> Latency (CL).  In Figure 2.8 the <span class="UliInvSig">CAS</span>
latency is 2.  It can be higher or lower, depending on the quality of
the memory controller, motherboard, and DRAM module.  The latency can
also have half values.  With CL=2.5 the first data would be available
at the first <i>falling</i> flank in the blue area.
</p><p>

With all this preparation to get to the data it would be wasteful to
only transfer one data word.  This is why DRAM modules allow the
memory controller to specify how much data is to be transmitted.
Often the choice is between 2, 4, or 8 words.  This allows filling
entire lines in the caches without a new <span class="UliInvSig">RAS</span>/<span class="UliInvSig">CAS</span> sequence.  It is also
possible for the memory controller to send a new <span class="UliInvSig">CAS</span> signal without
resetting the row selection.  In this way, consecutive memory addresses
can be read from or written to significantly faster because 
the <span class="UliInvSig">RAS</span> signal does not have to be sent and the row does
not have to be deactivated (see below).  Keeping the row &ldquo;open&rdquo; is
something the memory controller has to decide.  Speculatively leaving
it open all the time has disadvantages with real-world applications
(see [highperfdram]).  Sending new <span class="UliInvSig">CAS</span> signals is only subject
to the Command Rate of the RAM module (usually specified as T<i>x</i>,
where <i>x</i> is a value like 1 or 2; it will be 1 for high-performance DRAM
modules which accept new commands every cycle).
</p><p>


In this example the SDRAM spits out one word per cycle.  This is what
the first generation does.  DDR is able to transmit two words per
cycle.  This cuts down on the transfer time but does not change the
latency.  In principle, DDR2 works the same although in practice it
looks different.  There is no need to go into the details here.  It is
sufficient to note that DDR2 can be made faster, cheaper, more
reliable, and is more energy efficient (see [ddrtwo] for more
information).
</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>2.2.2 Precharge and Activation</b>
</p><p>
</p><p>

Figure 2.8 does not cover the whole cycle.  It only shows
parts of the full cycle of accessing DRAM.  Before a new <span class="UliInvSig">RAS</span> signal
can be sent the currently latched row must be deactivated and the new
row must be precharged.  We can concentrate here on the case where
this is done with an explicit command.  There are improvements to the
protocol which, in some situations, allows this extra step to be avoided.  The
delays introduced by precharging still affect the operation, though.
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<img src="cpumemory.11.png">
<p><b>Figure 2.9: SDRAM Precharge and Activation</b>

</p></blockquote>
<p>

Figure 2.9 shows the activity starting from one <span class="UliInvSig">CAS</span>
signal to the <span class="UliInvSig">CAS</span> signal for another row.  The data requested with
the first <span class="UliInvSig">CAS</span> signal is available as before, after CL cycles.  In the
example two words are requested which, on a simple SDRAM, takes two
cycles to transmit.  Alternatively, imagine four words on a DDR chip.
</p><p>

Even on DRAM modules with a command rate of one the precharge command
cannot be issued right away.  It is necessary to wait as long as it
takes to transmit the data.  In this case it takes two cycles.  This
happens to be the same as CL but that is just a coincidence.  The
precharge signal has no dedicated line;  instead, some implementations
issue it by
lowering the Write Enable (<span class="UliInvSig">WE</span>) and <span class="UliInvSig">RAS</span> line simultaneously.  This
combination has no useful meaning by itself (see [micronddr] for
encoding details).
</p><p>

Once the precharge command is issued it takes <span class="UliMath">t<sub>RP</sub></span> (Row Precharge
time) cycles until the row can be selected.  In Figure 2.9
much of the time (indicated by the purplish color) overlaps with the
memory transfer (light blue). This is good!  But <span class="UliMath">t<sub>RP</sub></span> is larger than
the transfer time and so the next <span class="UliInvSig">RAS</span> signal is stalled for one
cycle.
</p><p>

If we were to continue the timeline in the diagram we would find that
the next data transfer happens 5 cycles after the previous one stops.
This means the data bus is only in use two cycles out of seven.
Multiply this with the FSB speed and the theoretical 6.4GB/s for a
800MHz bus become 1.8GB/s.  That is bad and must be avoided.  The
techniques described in Section 6 help to raise this number.
But the programmer usually has to do her share.
</p><p>

There is one more timing value for a SDRAM module which we have not
discussed.  In Figure 2.9 the precharge command was only
limited by the data transfer time.  Another constraint is that an
SDRAM module needs time after a <span class="UliInvSig">RAS</span> signal before it can precharge
another row (denoted as <span class="UliMath">t<sub>RAS</sub></span>).  This number is usually pretty high,
in the order of two or three times the <span class="UliMath">t<sub>RP</sub></span> value.  This is a
problem if, after a <span class="UliInvSig">RAS</span> signal, only one <span class="UliInvSig">CAS</span> signal follows
and the data transfer is finished in a few cycles.  Assume that in
Figure 2.9 the initial <span class="UliInvSig">CAS</span> signal was preceded directly
by a <span class="UliInvSig">RAS</span> signal and that <span class="UliMath">t<sub>RAS</sub></span> is 8 cycles.  Then the precharge
command would have to be delayed by one additional cycle since the sum of
<span class="UliMath">t<sub>RCD</sub></span>, CL, and <span class="UliMath">t<sub>RP</sub></span> (since it is larger than the data transfer time)
is only 7 cycles.
</p><p>

DDR modules are often described using a special notation: w-x-y-z-T.
For instance: 2-3-2-8-T1.  This means:
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<table>

<tbody><tr><td>w </td><td> 2 </td><td> <span class="UliInvSig">CAS</span> Latency (CL)</td></tr> 
<tr><td>x </td><td> 3 </td><td> <span class="UliInvSig">RAS</span>-to-<span class="UliInvSig">CAS</span> delay (<span class="UliMath">t<sub>RCD</sub></span>)</td></tr> 
<tr><td>y </td><td> 2 </td><td> <span class="UliInvSig">RAS</span>
Precharge (<span class="UliMath">t<sub>RP</sub></span>)</td></tr> 
<tr><td>z </td><td> 8 </td><td> Active to Precharge delay (<span class="UliMath">t<sub>RAS</sub></span>)</td></tr> 
<tr><td>T </td><td> T1 </td><td> Command Rate</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>

There are numerous other timing constants which affect the way
commands can be issued and are handled.  Those five constants are in
practice sufficient to determine the performance of the module, though.
</p><p>

It is sometimes useful to know this information for the computers in
use to be able to interpret certain measurements.  It is
definitely useful to know these details when buying computers since
they, along with the FSB and SDRAM module speed, are
among the most important factors determining a computer's speed.
</p><p>

The very adventurous reader could also try to tweak a system.
Sometimes the BIOS allows changing some or all these values.  SDRAM
modules have programmable registers where these values can be set.
Usually the BIOS picks the best default value.  If the quality of the
RAM module is high it might be possible to reduce the one or the other
latency without affecting the stability of the computer.  Numerous
overclocking websites all around the Internet provide ample of
documentation for doing this.  Do it at your own risk, though and do not say
you have not been warned.
</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>2.2.3 Recharging</b>
</p><p>
</p><p>

A mostly-overlooked topic when it comes to DRAM access is recharging.
As explained in Section 2.1.2, DRAM cells must constantly be refreshed.
This does not happen completely transparently for the rest of the
system.  At times when a row {<i>Rows are the granularity this
happens with despite what [highperfdram] and other literature
says (see [micronddr]).</i>} is recharged no access is possible.  The
study in [highperfdram] found that &ldquo;<i>[s]urprisingly, DRAM
refresh organization can affect performance dramatically</i>&rdquo;.
</p><p>

Each DRAM cell must be refreshed every 64ms according to the JEDEC
specification.  If a DRAM array has 8,192 rows this means the memory
controller has to issue a refresh command on average every
7.8125&micro;s (refresh commands can be queued so in practice the
maximum interval between two requests can be higher).  It is the
memory controller's responsibility to schedule the refresh commands.
The DRAM module keeps track of the address of the last refreshed row
and automatically increases the address counter for each new request.
</p><p>

There is really not much the programmer can do about the refresh and
the points in time when the commands are issued.  But it is important
to keep this part to the DRAM life cycle in mind when interpreting
measurements.  If a critical word has to be retrieved from a row which
currently is being refreshed the processor could be stalled for quite a long
time.  How long each refresh takes depends on the DRAM module.
</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>2.2.4 Memory Types</b>

</p><p>

It is worth spending some time on the current and soon-to-be current
memory types in use.  We will start with SDR (Single Data Rate) SDRAMs
since they are the basis of the DDR (Double Data Rate) SDRAMs.  SDRs
were pretty simple.  The memory cells and the data transfer rate were
identical.
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<img src="cpumemory.15.png">
<p><b>Figure 2.10: SDR SDRAM Operation</b>

</p></blockquote>
<p>

In Figure 2.10 the DRAM cell array can output the memory content at
the same rate it can be transported over the memory bus.  If the DRAM
cell array can operate at 100MHz, the data transfer rate of the bus is thus
100Mb/s.  The frequency <i>f</i> for all components is the same.
Increasing the throughput of the DRAM chip is expensive since the
energy consumption rises with the frequency.  With a huge number of
array cells this is prohibitively expensive.  {<i>Power = Dynamic
Capacity&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;Voltage<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;Frequency.</i>}  In reality it is
even more of a problem since increasing the frequency usually also
requires increasing the voltage to maintain stability of the system.
DDR SDRAM (called DDR1
retroactively) manages to improve the throughput without increasing
any of the involved frequencies.
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<img src="cpumemory.16.png">
<p><b>Figure 2.11: DDR1 SDRAM Operation</b>

</p></blockquote>
<p>

The difference between SDR and DDR1 is, as can be seen in
Figure 2.11 and guessed from the name, that twice the amount of
data is transported per cycle.  I.e., the DDR1 chip transports data on
the rising <i>and</i> falling edge.  This is sometimes called a
&ldquo;double-pumped&rdquo; bus.  To make this possible without increasing the
frequency of the cell array a buffer has to be introduced.  This
buffer holds two bits per data line.  This in turn requires that, in
the cell array in Figure 2.7, the data bus consists of two
lines.  Implementing this is trivial: one only has the use the same
column address for two DRAM cells and access them in parallel.  The
changes to the cell array to implement this are also minimal.  
</p><p>

The SDR
DRAMs were known simply by their frequency (e.g., PC100 for 100MHz
SDR).  To make DDR1 DRAM sound better the marketers had to come up
with a new scheme since the frequency did not change.  They came with
a name which contains the transfer rate in bytes a DDR module (they
have 64-bit busses) can sustain:
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>

	100MHz &times; 64bit &times; 2 = 1,600MB/s
</blockquote>
<p>

Hence a DDR module with 100MHz frequency is called PC1600.  With 1600
&gt; 100 all marketing requirements are fulfilled; it sounds much
better although the improvement is really <i>only</i> a factor of
two.  {<i>I will take the factor of two but I do not have to like
  the inflated numbers.</i>}
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<img src="cpumemory.17.png">
<p><b>Figure 2.12: DDR2 SDRAM Operation</b>

</p></blockquote>
<p>

To get even more out of the memory technology DDR2 includes a bit more
innovation.  The most obvious change that can be seen in
Figure 2.12 is the doubling of the frequency of the bus.
Doubling the frequency means doubling the bandwidth.  Since this
doubling of the frequency is not economical for the cell array it is
now required that the I/O buffer gets four bits in each clock cycle
which it then can send on the bus.  This means the changes to the DDR2
modules consist of making only the I/O buffer component of the DIMM
capable of running at higher speeds.  This is certainly possible and
will not require measurably more energy, it is just one tiny component and
not the whole module.  The names the marketers came up with for DDR2
are similar to the DDR1 names only in the computation of the value the
factor of two is replaced by four (we now have a quad-pumped bus).
Figure 2.13 shows the names of the modules in use today.

<p>

There is one more twist to the naming.  The FSB speed used by CPU,
motherboard, and DRAM module is specified by using the
<i>effective</i> frequency.  I.e., it factors in the transmission 
on both flanks of the clock cycle and thereby inflates
the number.  So, a 133MHz module with a 266MHz bus has an FSB
&ldquo;frequency&rdquo; of 533MHz.
</p><p>

The specification for DDR3 (the real one, not the fake GDDR3 used in
graphics cards) calls for more changes along the lines of the
transition to DDR2.  The voltage will be reduced from 1.8V
for DDR2 to 1.5V for DDR3.  Since the power consumption equation is
calculated using the square of the voltage this alone brings a
30% improvement.  Add to this a reduction in die size plus other
electrical advances and DDR3 can manage, at the same frequency, to get
by with half the power consumption.  Alternatively, with higher
frequencies, the same power envelope can be hit.  Or with double the
capacity the same heat emission can be achieved.
</p><p>

The cell array of DDR3 modules will run at a quarter of the speed of
the external bus which requires an 8&nbsp;bit I/O buffer, up from 4&nbsp;bits
for DDR2.  See Figure 2.14 for the schematics.
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>

<p><b>Figure 2.14: DDR3 SDRAM Operation</b>

</p></blockquote>
<p>

Initially DDR3 modules will likely have slightly higher <span class="UliInvSig">CAS</span>
latencies just because the DDR2 technology is more mature.  This would
cause DDR3 to be useful only at frequencies which are higher than those
which can be achieved with DDR2, and, even then, mostly when bandwidth is more
important than latency.  There is already talk about 1.3V modules
which can achieve the same <span class="UliInvSig">CAS</span> latency as DDR2.  In any case, the
possibility of achieving higher speeds because of faster buses will
outweigh the increased latency.
</p><p>

One possible problem with DDR3 is that, for 1,600Mb/s transfer rate or
higher, the number of modules per channel may be reduced to just one.
In earlier versions this requirement held for all frequencies, so 
one can hope that the requirement will at some point be lifted for all
frequencies.  Otherwise the capacity of systems will be severely limited.
</p><p>

Figure 2.15 shows the names of the expected DDR3 modules.
JEDEC agreed so far on the first four types.  Given that Intel's 45nm
processors have an FSB speed of 1,600Mb/s, the 1,866Mb/s is needed for
the overclocking market.  We will likely see more of this towards the end
of the DDR3 lifecycle.

<p><b>Figure 2.15: DDR3 Module Names</b>

<p>

All DDR memory has one problem: the increased bus frequency makes it
hard to create parallel data busses.  A DDR2 module has 240 pins.  All
connections to data and address pins must be routed so that they have
approximately the same length.  Even more of a problem is that, if more
than one DDR module is to be daisy-chained on the same bus, the signals
get more and more distorted for each additional module.  The DDR2
specification allow only two modules per bus (aka channel), the DDR3
specification only one module for high frequencies.  With 240 pins per
channel a single Northbridge cannot reasonably drive more than two
channels.  The alternative is to have external memory controllers (as
in Figure 2.2) but this is expensive.
</p><p>

What this means is that commodity motherboards are restricted to hold
at most four DDR2 or DDR3 modules.  This restriction severely limits the
amount of memory a system can have.  Even old 32-bit IA-32 processors
can handle 64GB of RAM and memory demand even for home use is growing,
so something has to be done.
</p><p>

One answer is to add memory controllers into each processor as
explained in Section 2.  AMD does it with the Opteron
line and Intel will do it with their CSI technology.  This will help
as long as the reasonable amount of memory a processor is able to use
can be connected to a single processor.  In some situations this is
not the case and this setup will introduce a NUMA architecture and its negative
effects.  For some situations another solution is needed.
</p><p>

Intel's answer to this problem for big server machines, at least for
the next years, is called Fully
Buffered DRAM (FB-DRAM).  The FB-DRAM modules use the same components
as today's DDR2 modules which makes them relatively cheap to produce.
The difference is in the connection with the memory controller.
Instead of a parallel data bus FB-DRAM utilizes a serial bus (Rambus
DRAM had this back when, too, and SATA is the successor of PATA, as is
PCI Express for PCI/AGP).  The serial bus can be driven at a much
higher frequency, reverting the negative impact of the serialization and
even increasing the bandwidth.  The main effects of using a serial bus
are
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li> more modules per channel can be used.
</li><li> more channels per Northbridge/memory controller can be used.
</li><li> the serial bus is designed to be fully-duplex (two lines).
</li></ol>
<p>

An FB-DRAM module has only 69 pins, compared with the 240 for DDR2.
Daisy chaining FB-DRAM modules is much easier since the electrical
effects of the bus can be handled much better.  The FB-DRAM
specification allows up to 8 DRAM modules per channel.
</p><p>

Compared with the connectivity requirements of a dual-channel
Northbridge it is now possible to drive 6 channels of FB-DRAM with
fewer pins: 2&times;240 pins versus 6&times;69 pins.  The routing
for each channel is much simpler which could also help reducing the
cost of the motherboards.
</p><p>

Fully duplex parallel busses are prohibitively expensive for the
traditional DRAM modules, duplicating all those lines is too costly.
With serial lines (even if they are differential, as FB-DRAM requires)
this is not the case and so the serial bus is designed to be fully
duplexed, which means, in some situations, that the bandwidth is theoretically
doubled alone by this.  But it is not the only place where parallelism
is used for bandwidth increase.  Since an FB-DRAM controller can run
up to six channels at the same time the bandwidth can be increased
even for systems with smaller amounts of RAM by using FB-DRAM.  Where
a DDR2 system with four modules has two channels, the same capacity can
handled via four channels using an ordinary FB-DRAM controller.  The
actual bandwidth of the serial bus depends on the type of DDR2 (or
DDR3) chips used on the FB-DRAM module.
</p><p>

We can summarize the advantages like this:
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td></td><td>DDR2 </td><td> FB-DRAM</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="3"><hr></td></tr>
<tr><td>Pins </td><td> 240 </td><td> 69</td></tr>
<tr><td>Channels </td><td> 2 </td><td> 6</td></tr>
<tr><td>DIMMs/Channel </td><td> 2 </td><td> 8</td></tr>
<tr><td>Max Memory </td><td> 16GB </td><td> 192GB</td></tr>
<tr><td>Throughput </td><td> ~10GB/s </td><td> ~40GB/s</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>

There are a few drawbacks to FB-DRAMs if multiple DIMMs on one channel
are used.  The signal is delayed&mdash;albeit minimally&mdash;at each DIMM in the
chain, which means the latency increases.  But for the same amount of
memory with the same frequency FB-DRAM can always be faster than DDR2
and DDR3 since only one DIMM per channel is needed; for large
memory systems DDR simply has no answer using commodity components.
</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>2.2.5 Conclusions</b>

</p><p>

This section should have shown that accessing DRAM is not an
arbitrarily fast process.  At least not fast compared with the speed
the processor is running and with which it can access registers and
cache.  It is important to keep in mind the differences between CPU and
memory frequencies.  An Intel Core 2 processor running at 2.933GHz and a
1.066GHz FSB have a clock ratio of 11:1 (note: the 1.066GHz bus is
quad-pumped).  Each stall of one cycle on the memory bus means a stall
of 11 cycles for the processor.  For most machines the actual DRAMs
used are slower, thusly increasing the delay.  Keep these numbers in
mind when we are talking about stalls in the upcoming sections.
</p><p>

The timing charts for the read command have shown that DRAM modules
are capable of high sustained data rates.  Entire DRAM rows could be
transported without a single stall.  The data bus could be kept
occupied 100%.  For DDR modules this means two 64-bit words
transferred each cycle.  With DDR2-800 modules and two channels this
means a rate of 12.8GB/s.
</p><p>

But, unless designed this way, DRAM access is not always sequential.
Non-continuous memory regions are used which means precharging and new
<span class="UliInvSig">RAS</span> signals are needed.  This is when things slow down and when the
DRAM modules need help.  The sooner the precharging can happen and the
<span class="UliInvSig">RAS</span> signal sent the smaller the penalty when the row is actually
used.
</p><p>

Hardware and software prefetching (see Section 6.3) can be used
to create more overlap in the timing and reduce the stall.
Prefetching also helps shift memory operations in time so that there
is less contention at later times, right before the data is actually
needed.  This is a frequent problem when the data produced in one
round has to be stored and the data required for the next round has to be
read.  By shifting the read in time, the write and read operations do
not have to be issued at basically the same time.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h3>2.3 Other Main Memory Users</h3>
<p>

Beside the CPUs there are other system components which can access the
main memory.  High-performance cards such as network and mass-storage
controllers cannot afford to pipe all the data they need or provide
through the CPU.  Instead, they read or write the data directly from/to
the main memory (Direct Memory Access, DMA).  In Figure 2.1
we can see that the cards can talk through the South- and Northbridge
directly with the memory.  Other buses, like USB, also require FSB
bandwidth&mdash;even though they do not use DMA&mdash;since the Southbridge is
connected to the Northbridge through the FSB, too.
</p><p>

While DMA is certainly beneficial, it means that there is more
competition for the FSB bandwidth.  In times with high DMA traffic the
CPU might stall more than usual while waiting for data from the main
memory.  There are ways around this given the right hardware.  With an
architecture as in Figure 2.3 one can make sure the computation
uses memory on nodes which are not affected by DMA.  It is also
possible to attach a Southbridge to each node, equally
distributing the load on the FSB of all the nodes.  There are a myriad
of possibilities.  In Section 6 we will introduce techniques and
programming interfaces which help achieving the improvements which are
possible in software.
</p><p>

Finally it should be mentioned that some cheap systems have graphics
systems without separate, dedicated video RAM.  Those systems use
parts of the main memory as video RAM.  Since access to the video RAM
is frequent (for a 1024x768 display with 16 bpp at 60Hz we are talking
94MB/s) and system memory, unlike RAM on graphics cards, does not have
two ports this can substantially influence the systems performance
and especially the latency.  It is best to ignore such systems
when performance is a priority.  They are more trouble than they are worth.
People buying those machines know they will not get the best
performance.

Is there a 4-way hyperthreading variant I haven't heard about?  I thought HT was always viewed as two CPUs by the Linux kernel (well, assuming it's enabled in the BIOS and the kernel config), which would imply no more than 32 virtual processors.  Did I miss something here?

    I'm not totally sure what the author's referring to, but hyper threading is coming back. Of course, the Sun Niagara chip does 4 threads per core, rather than two, and IBM's Power series has been doing SMT (hyper threading by another name) for some time. <a href="http://anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/intel/showdoc.aspx?i=3101&p=2">http://anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/intel/showdoc.aspx?i=310...</a> talks about 8 core Intel CPUs that will support hyper threading per core for 16 threads per CPU.<br>

    Please realize that Intel's "Hyperthreading" is not the same as "Multi-threading" as implemented by other vendors.  Hyperthreading will often give you worse performance than simply using one core (ie, turning hyperthreading off).<br>
<p>

Multi-threading, as in real SMT, will actually give you a performance improvement, but just not a linear one like adding an extra full core would.  For example, extra hardware threads on the Niagara give about the same improvement as about 50% of a CPU.<br>
</p><p>

I've done tests to verify this on our servers, and as a result I disable Hyperthreading on all of our compute nodes.  Don't take my word for it though, run tests yourself.<br>

    In my experience, running almost any two perl tasks in parallel on a HT tends to take longer in wallclock time than running the two one after the other (keeping the other hyperthread idle). The difference is not large, but it tends to be a few percentage points slower with hyperthreading than without.<br>
<p>

I pondered this for a while, and thought that it might be because each hyperthread in turn pushes the cached data of the other hyperthread off the cpu, resulting in expensive memory re-fetches which in this case actually negate the advantage of utilizing the idle CPU computation units.<br>
</p><p>

Even so, I'd still keep HT enabled for web servers and like. This is because the small loss in throughput is likely to be repaid by a small decrease of system latency. Two processors, even two "half-speed" ones, can still do two tasks at the same time, and short computation bursts can well occur faster thanks to increased likelihood of there being an idle core immediately available for the task.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>

It's roughly that effect, but this actual scenario doesn't happen, because a hyperthread timeslice lasts only until the next cache miss and there is more than one line of cache.  The point of hyperthreading is to let Thread B run while Thread A is waiting to get stuff into cache.
</p><p>

However, you do have the simple problem of having only half the locality in the memory cache.  If two threads are in greatly different contexts, each will get half the cache and half a cache might make it take significantly longer to get something done than a whole cache.
</p><p>

But I think the usual reason for hyperthreading slowdown is just the overhead of switching threads.  If that exceeds the time you would sit idle waiting for memory access in the single thread case, the double thread has less throughput than the single thread.
</p><p>

What should have been said along with the 50% number above is that it is just for some highly average workload.  The effect of hyperthreading has a great deal to do with how much memory access the programs do.  A system that spends most of its time moving stuff around in memory will not benefit from hyperthreading.  But a system that spends half its time accessing memory and the other half computing in registers and near caches might get close to double the throughput with 2 hyperthreads.
</p><p>

I usually turn off hyperthreading just to restore consistency.  Otherwise, my speed varies almost randomly.

    <blockquote>But I think the usual reason for hyperthreading slowdown

</blockquote>

In SMT (and that includes hyperthreading), there is no thread
switching overhead.  The execution core just executes instructions
from different contexts at the same time (but in different resources).

<p>I don't know why the Pentium 4 variant of SMT performs as badly as
it does; cache thrashing may contribute, but I don't think that this
is the main reason.  The main reasons are probably some obscure
microarchitectural details, maybe the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_system">replay system</a>,
maybe something else.

    I don't think that is a fair comparison.  You would need to compare running two perl tasks in parallel with HT versus running two in parallel without HT.  That will tell you whether HT itself gives any performance improvement for parallel-perl workloads, and so may give a clue about whether to enable it on a production web server (which presumably is running lots of perl jobs at once).<br>
<p>

Whether your two programs are best scheduled in parallel or serially is another question - as you found out, it may be faster to run one then the other.  This does not necessarily imply that hyperthreading should be turned off.<br>

    Hyperthreading is generally not a win on workloads that are already well-optimized.  If the application is making effective use of the cache, and is compiled to minimize pipeline bubbles, hyperthreading will just reduce your cache hit rate.<br>
<p>

The problem that Hyperthreading solves quite well is workloads that cannot be well-optimized because they react to unpredictable external events, as is the case with web servers.  It's also beneficial on desktop systems where having only one CPU can harm interactivity while background tasks are running, but in the age of multicore CPUs that won't be much of an issue.<br>
</p><p>

As a rule of thumb, the more performance tuning you're doing on a system, the more likely it is you'll want to disable Hyperthreading.  HPC nodes and centralized database servers definitely suffer, while build systems and static web servers definitely benefit.<br>

    Very nice article.  You did address power issues obliquely when talking about DDR3, but I'm surprised you didn't mention the power drawbacks of FB-DIMM.  The fast shift register on each DIMM requires a few watts more than a standard DDR2 module.  And when you add more DIMMs to an FB-DIMM system, all memory access becomes slower, not just access to DIMMs at the end of chains.  For example on a particular system I have here memory performance is best with 4 FB-DIMMs and a bit slower with 8.<br>

    AMD's next server socket will <a href="http://www.hothardware.com/News/More_AMD_G3MX_Details_Emerge/">put four buffers per socket on the motherboard</a> and otherwise use regular DDR3 DIMMs. Which is kind of like the external memory controller scenario, but connected direct to the CPU. Intel is rumoured to be developing something similar called AMB2.

    Actually only the interface at the memory controller is 69 pins
(allowing more channels from one memory controller chip).  The FB-DIMM
needs these 69 pins, plus 69 pins to talk to the next FB-DIMM, plus
additional pins for power and ground; that's why they have the
familiar 240-pin form factor.

    <p>For such a detailed and well-written article, I'm surprised that banks weren't mentioned.  In short, a memory chip contains 4 or 8 banks, which each contain rows, which each contain columns.  With regards to the timing constraints mentioned regarding rows, each bank is almost completely independent.  Behaviourly, this means that you can activate, read, write and precharge each bank concurrently.  (There's only one shared data bus, of course, but this allows you to talk to one bank while another is busy internally.)</p>

<p>I work for a memory manufacturer, but I don't know much about how our stuff is actually used.  So maybe this doesn't actually help, speed-wise, and that's why Ulrich didn't mention it.</p>

<p>I have a few other comments/suggestions:
</p><ul>
<li>I wouldn't bother mentioning half-latencies.  DDR only had one, 2.5, but DDR2 and beyond don't have any.</li>

<li>Speaking of CAS latencies, they're only getting worse.  Higher clock speeds means higher latencies, period.  You could run DDR parts at CAS latency 2, 2.5, or 3.  DDR2 latencies go from 3 up to 7, I believe.</li>

<li><p>I don't understand the foot-note part of this quote: "As explained in Section 2.1.2, DRAM cells must constantly be refreshed. This does not happen completely transparently for the rest of the system. At times when a row {Rows are the granularity this happens with despite what [highperfdram] and other literature says (see [micronddr]).} is recharged no access is possible."</p>

<p>I don't know what the literature says--Can we get links to that stuff?--but <b>all</b> banks have to be precharged during a refresh event.  (To be specific, this is an "auto-refresh"--"self-refresh" is a low-power mode.)</p></li>

    <p>While there are subtle differences between two-banks DIMM and two single-bank DIMMs (related to refresh as you've correctly pointed out) from software point of view they are more-or-less identical. I think this is why it was omitted from article. And the question "what the hell does latency 2.5 mean?" is common (less so today when DDR is almost history and DDR2 is mainstream, but still) so I think few lines are worth it...</p>

    <p>You're confusing the terms "banks" and "ranks."</p>

<p>Ulrich goes into quite a bit of detail about how an address is broken into a "row" and "column" component, but there is a third component, bank, <em>internal to the DRAM</em>.</p>

<p>A DIMM[1] can be single-rank or dual-rank.  When you write or read a single-rank DIMM, you talk to every memory component on the DIMM, every time.  Dual-rank DIMMs have double the number of components as a single-rank DIMM, and when you write or read (activate or precharge, for that matter) you only talk to half of the components.</p>

<p>What any of this has to do with software, I don't know.  I work with some absolutely lousy programmers who know quite a bit more about memory than I do.  :)</p>

<p>[1] I know this holds for unbuffered DIMMs, but I don't know about fully-buffered DIMMs.  I don't work with those.</p>

    unfortunately, the memory management in Linux is completely transparent to userspace which means the advantages of placing your data in different banks is totally not doable.<br>
<p>

it's really only possible when you're writing your own bare-metal applications as then you have full control over the physical memory layout.  your custom linker scripts would place the data such that you make sure specific pieces of data lie in specific banks.<br>
</p><p>

of course, this is beyond the stated scope as it isnt Linux :)<br>

    Now you've got the Gentoo crowd double checking their linker man page...  :)<br>
<p>

Seriously, I've heard that the translation from a physical address to a particular bank/row/column combination is specific to the memory controller.  Which makes perfect sense.<br>
</p><p>

Also, let me make this clear: my bank comment was in regards to the "more details than you really need to know" section anyway.  With Linux and/or random, commodity hardware, you can't call out a specific row or column either.  But if you're going to talk about rows and columns, you ought to at least mention banks, the third address component of a modern DRAM.  ("Modern DRAM" here means, approximately, anything I'm familiar with: Sync-DRAM, DDR, DDR2, etc.)<br>

    i might point out that linker scripts arent documented in the linker man page<br>
<p>

i obviously cant read minds, but i think the discussion of being able to scan rows without re-issuing a CAS command will lead into the idea of accessing data in a certain fashion (in sequential lines) rather than much more randomly ... whereas with banks, exhibiting certain behavior at runtime wont matter since in general, being in different banks is random<br>

    <p>It does not matter if GPU is only used while system is initially set up: it will still suck performance from system. That said most server motherboards nowadays have old, slow, yet dedicated GPU with separate memory chip - exactly to free system bus...</p>

    I assume the performance sucking comes from the fact that the video controller is constantly reading from the memory to refresh the screen, even if no one is looking at it or no monitor is plugged in.
<p>

Modern computers have power-saving features that disable the display after a period of no keyboard/mouse activity.  Does that shut down the refresh in the video controller, thus eliminating the performance impact?
</p><p>

What about DVI?  VGA CRTs have to be refreshed constantly, from the video controller (and a VGA LCD monitor, emulating a CRT, would too), but what about DVI LCD display?

    <p>DVI requires constant refresh too. It's not needed for modern LCD - that's just how DVI is designed.</p>

<p>As for needless polling when monitor is power save mode... Few years ago it was certainly true anyway - but times are changing. May be latest integrated CPUs are stopping this useless polling when there are no need, I just don't know.</p>

    Are you sure? <br>
<p>

My impression was that active matrix LCDs worked a lot like DRAM. They had a transistor and a capacitor for each pixel (the transistor was added in the move from passive to active matrix), but the voltage on that capacitor decayed and needed to be periodically refreshed. I was unaware of LCD displays having any on-board memory from which to do the refresh, but that could have been added while I wasn't following the market, although I'd be surprised, since it seems like it'd be an unnecessary cost item. <br>

It's not the physics, but the modernness that I think makes the refresh not necessary for LCDs at the level it is for CRTs:  If I were designing a monitor in the 1990s out of parts that need to be refreshed (even a CRT), I would put required refresh function inside,rather than pass the responsibility off to the computer.  In SVGA days, though, it probably made sense to keep the monitor dumb.
</p><p>

But I guess DVI designers decided the computer wants to update the picture by a full raster scan 60 times a second anyway, so there's no need for internal refresh.  Doing a little reading just now, it looks like the DVI data stream is a simple raster scan.  It even apparently has "blanking intervals," though they couldn't possibly be for same purpose as on a CRT.

DVI's timing and blanking intervals are the same as VGA's. I believe it was designed this way to 
make the modification to the video cards easier, and to facilitate dual-output DVI / VGA video 
cards. (so the VGA port is basically just the DVI port with an extra D2A converter in the path.)

    <blockquote>

<p>

This series is announced by U. Drepper some time ago, see <a href="http://udrepper.livejournal.com/17682.html">here</a> (mhm, and few day ago I grumbled here at linking to blogs...); it is mentioned there that PDF will be released once this series completed.

</p><p>

As all commenters above, I enjoyed reading first installment.  However, I think also there are segments that could be further improved, in order to really have this text as ultimate reference for memory related topics.  For example, static RAM diagram could be explained better (remember that this text is directed towards programmers, that may have not much EE related background), as well as DRAM refreshing (it is left somewhat unclear how DRAM cell is returned to its initial value after practically destroying this value during read operation - this is say much more clear at block diagram from corresponding Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_random_access_memory">article</a> than from Figure 2.7 from text above), etc.  That sort of stuff is usually  explained in all of its glory detail in digital logic design books (for example in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Contemporary-Logic-Design-Randy-Katz/dp/0201308576">Katz/Boririello</a> seminal work), but maybe it could be worth trying to digest it for this kind of text too...

    Here's a little grammar fix for the article:

    Another little fix:<br>
<p>

"reverting negative impact of the serialization and even increase the bandwidth."<br>
</p><p>

would be more grammatically correct as,<br>
</p><p>

"reverting the negative impact of the serialization and even increasing the bandwidth."<br>
</p><p>

(add "the", add "ing".)<br>
</p><p>

You could also drop "the" before both serialization and bandwidth, for improved flow.  If it were my sentence, I'd write it this way:<br>
</p><p>

"... reverting the negative impact of serialization, and even increasing total bandwidth."<br>

    <p>I spotted another grammar oops. In section 2 ("Commodity Hardware Today"), seventh paragraph (the one immediately after the first bullet-point list), the last sentence reads: "This problem, therefore, <i>must to be</i> taken into account." That should be either "<i>needs to be</i> taken into account" or "<i>must be</i> taken into account."</p>

<p>This is, of course, an artifact of editing the paper, where "needs to be" was changed into "must be" at some point but the leftover "to" was missed.</p>

    Hate to complain, but seeing [interestingsoundingreferences], and not being able to <br>

    <blockquote>

<p>

And at the <em>top</em> of the article, it basically says that (and shows it in a drawing).
</p><p>

A similar contention question left open is that of contention in the Northbridge.  Can that be a bottleneck?  And what is it for, anyway?  One could imagine the memory controller being directly on the FSB.

    The northbridge is the barrier between the CPU domain (FSB, HT, etc.), which has to deal with cache coherency, locking, interrupt delivery, etc. and the rest of the system, which simply passes serial messages or parallel data/address tuples around.  On a sufficiently primitive system you don't really need one, but all modern commodity microarchitectures have something like a northbridge either on the chipset or the processor itself.<br>
<p>

As for bottlenecks, even if the northbridge itself has enough internal bandwidth between all of its ports to function in a non-blocking fashion, you can't have a bottleneck-free network unless both the CPU and the I/O controllers have dedicated bandwidth to the memory.  That only makes sense with multi-port DRAM, which isn't used for main memory in any commodity system.<br>

    "... but the none of them need be aware of the circuit design. None."<br>
<p>

There are programmers out there, who write memory controller configuration code for boot loaders. I have done it and knowing the electrical design of memory cells really helped to answer simple questions like why the hell does DRAM need a configurable controller while the onchip SRAM is nicely ready for use right after powerup.<br>

    Personally, I think it is useful to have a reasonable knowledge one level of abstraction down, and one level of abstraction up. There are a number of reasons for this: 
<ul>
<li> You can often find optimizations that cross abstraction barriers. It is difficult to predict what you'll need to know to do this, so you really need to have a deep understanding of both layers. In some cases, you can also influence the hardware design. 
</li><li> You can predict how the technology may evolve. 
</li><li> You gain intellectual depth. 
</li></ul>
This is especially important for systems programmers -- the target of this article. If I'm designing a kernel, or a virtual machine (as in JVM, or .net runtime), or a high-performance systems library, I want to design it in such a way that it can take advantage of possible future underlying technologies. 
<p>

Indeed, in many cases, I may even be able to influence underlying technologies. If I am aware of the circuit requirements of memory refresh, I can design code that explicitly leaves time for the refresh, while giving good bandwidth and latency when the memory is actually accessed. If something is a good idea, and a major OS or runtime can take advantage of it, you can bet that hardware designers somewhere will add support for it. 
</p><p>
 
The major reason most CPUs only have 2-4 cores today, and didn't have multiple cores a while ago, was that software could not take advantage of them. Right now, optimum performance comes from about 64 cores at 700MHz each (the Tilera processor), but it can only be used in esoteric applications because software designers a decade ago were not aware of where the hardware is headed, and did not design applications, languages, or run-times in a parallelism-friendly way (programmer-friendly parallelism is only starting to happen today with languages like Fortress).

    Agreed.  But knowing how a dram cell is implemented is more than one level of abstraction below low-level programming, and that is more than one level of abstraction below what "every" programmer will ever deal with.<br>

But I'm not going to reply to anything specific here and now.  This is just section 2 (with 1 only being an introduction).  Some of what has been discussed in comments goes far beyond what is in these sections.  Once you've read section 6 you probably have a better understanding about what is covered and what isn't (and to some extend: why certain things are covered in the first place).<br>
</p><p>

So, don't regard my silence as a sign of disinterest, it just means that many questions will automatically be answered later.<br>

    Two more clarification-comments:

<p>
<font color="#880044"><i>Recent RAM types require two separate buses (or channels as they are called for DDR2, see Figure 2.8) which doubles the available bandwidth.</i></font>

</p><p>

Unless I'm missing something fundamental, Figure 2.8 has nothing to do with DDR2 channels.  Indeed, I don't believe the comment even refers to Figures 2.12 or 2.13; I see nothing relevant.  Perhaps the figure in question was dropped at some point?

</p><p>
<font color="#880044"><i>In this example the SDRAM spits out one word per cycle.</i></font>

</p><p>

Here and in several other places, the text is ambiguous.  "Cycle" in this context apparently means clock cycle, but there's an implicit (larger) cycle measured from RAS to RAS (for example) that defines the overall throughput.  Figure 2.8 actually shows four words going out in that larger cycle.

    I'm delighted to see this series, thanks for running it.  It's always frustrated me that people who develop software often have no clue what's going on underneath, and as a result write hideous code.  E.G., yes, it <i>does</i> matter what order you access matrices in.  I presume this series will eventually get there.
<p>

Also: let me say that I <i>like</i> the SI binary prefixes (GiByte, etc.); when computer memories were 48K, the difference between the binary and decimal prefixes didn't matter much, but as everything is getting bigger/faster, the differences have getting bigger too.  When you're being imprecise, it doesn't matter, but when you want to be precise (e.g., when describing product specs or presenting a diagnostic report), I find them REALLY helpful.  In some circumstances it's also the law: claiming your product does something, but not actually meeting your claims (because you used the wrong prefix) can actually get you hauled into court.
There's a much bigger world beyond computing, and they already know what "Giga" means; it's 10^9.

    <div class="FormattedComment"><pre>When we dealt with numbers in the thousands (10^3), approximating a kilo as 2^10 was only 2.5%
off.  Now that we routinely deal with numbers in the billions (10^9), approximating a giga as
2^30 is 7.5% off.  Some of us already deal with numbers in the trillions (10^12), and
approximating a tera as 2^40 is a full 10% off!

Now if you do binary arithmetic in your head, so that when you see 14,463,188,475,466, you
instantly know that it is 13.2 * 2^40, then this comment doesn't apply to you.  But you don't.
When you see "14,463,188,475,466" you approximate it in your head as "14.5 gigs".  If you tell
someone else that you are looking at 14.5 gigs, and they think that you mean 14.5 2^40's, then
they are overestimating the number you are looking at by more than 10%!

A "kilo" has meant 10^3 to the scientific world since 1795.  A "tera" has meant 10^12 since
1960.  Programmers use of units are eventually going to have to become compatible with the
larger scientific world, not least because the numbers we deal with are getting bigger.

While lecturing people about the value of using precise terminology, I accidentally wrote
"gigs" when I meant "teras".

If it had been gigs, the people in the example would have been only 7.5% off.

Sorry about that.

    The article here is primarily about x86 type systems, assumes (I think) 64 bit multi-core CPUs, and also assumes a general computing environment.  Extending this to other architectures might make it more useful (not that it's not a good overview so far; I learned a few things, and it's only 1/7th of the way through) to the folks this will matter the most to -- the embedded Linux programmer.  Embedded programmers have more control over their environment than typical user-space programmers, and often need to tweak things to get rid of every wasted cycle possible.<br>
<p>

Better knowing how the memory works, how it's connected to the rest of the system, and how software can be written to take this into account can lead to better performance.  If this is applied at the kernel level when organizing kernel data structures and code, as well as in the design of service code (DMA, paging, interrupt handlers, data streams/pipes, IPC, etc.) could lead to better system performance.<br>
</p><p>

Thanks for the article.  I look forward to the rest of the parts.<br>

    You have missed the bit that the '1.066Ghz' bus is 'quad-pumped' so isn't really 1GHz at all: it is a quarter of that. Hence about 11:1 rather than about 3:1 ration between clock speeds. I just learned this from the above article (I had been taken in by marketers before and assumed that FSB speeds were real :-)<br>
