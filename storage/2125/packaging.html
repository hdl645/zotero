This case is pretty straight forward. All the branches are available
to eveyone, and work may be based off any of them. However, the branch
history, for any topic branch, is full of merge nodes where code from
upstream was merged, which some people see as clutter.

"Are you rebasing or merging?" seems to be the 64 thousand dollar
question over in <a href="http://vcs-pkg.org/">vcs-pkg</a> discussions. Various people have offered
their preferences, and indeed, several case studies of work flows have
been presented, what is lacking is an <u>analysis</u> of the work-flow; an
exploration of which methodology has advantages, and whether there are
scenarios in which the <u>other</u> work flow would have been better.
</p>
<p>

Oh, what are all these work flows about, you ask?  Most of the issues
with packaging software for distributions have a few things in common:
there is a mainline or upstream source of development. There are zero
or more independent lines of development or ongoing bug fixes that are
to be managed. And then there is the tree from which the distribution
package is to be built. All this talk about packaging software work
flows is how to best manage asynchronous development upstream and in
the independent lines of development, and how to create a coherent,
debuggable, integrated tree from which to build the distributions
package.
</p>
<p>

The rebasing question goes to the heart of how to handle the
independent lines of development using git; since these lines of
development are based off the main line of development, and must be
periodically synchronized.  What follows here is a first look at a
couple of important factors that will have bearing on that question,
and packaging software for a distribution using Git in general. This
is heavily geared towards git (nothing else does rebases so easily, I
think), but some of the concepts should be generic. I am not
considering the stacked set of quilt patches source controlled with
Git in this article (I don't understand that model well enough to do
an analysis)
</p>
<p>

As a teaser, there is a third answer: neither. You can just add an
independent line of development, and just let it sit: don't rebase,
and don't merge; and in some circumstances that is a winning
strategy. 
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div style="display: none; visibility: hidden;" id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<div style="display: block; visibility: visible;"><div style="display: inline; float: right; text-align: right; font-size: 70%; font-weight: normal;"><a accesskey="t" href="javascript:org_html_manager.toggleView(2);">toggle view</a></div></div><h2 onmouseout="org_html_manager.unhighlight_headline(this);" onmouseover="org_html_manager.highlight_headline(this);" style="cursor: pointer;" onclick="org_html_manager.fold(2);" id="sec-2">2 Interested constituencies</h2>
<div style="display: block; visibility: visible;" id="text-2">


<p>

Take the rebasing issue.  First, rebasing is for private branches --
not for anything you publish. Whether or not you should have a private
branch that you rebase or not depends on a number of factors --
firstly, there is the question of which of the stake holder
constituencies are most important to you. There are at least three
constituencies involved here:
</p>
<ol>
<li>

Upstream developers. These are the people who are the consumers of
the independent lines of development. Usually people go out of
their way to feed patches and code in the preferred form acceptable
to upstream; and it is in our interests to do so: the more code
pushed upstream, the less work there is to do ourselves. People
upstream want the patch submissions to be clean, not have
extraneous crud that has to be removed, and would like a nice,
clean, uncomplicated history. They care about descriptions of each
patch in a series, but are not interested history, really (they do
not care that it took 15 typographical and logic fixes to arrive at
this juncture.) Upstreams want topic branches to be rebased to
their latest version, so that the patches apply cleanly and are
minimal.
</li>
<li>

Downstream topic developers. These are people who are basing their
work on your topic branches, and they develop code, and feed their
changes back to you. If you rewrite history and rebase your topic
branches, downstream developers will find it very hard to merge
from you back into their development tree. Indeed, if you publish
your topic branches for downstream developers to base their changes
on, rebasing is not an option.

<p>

If you publish a branch (whether or not you mean downstream
developers to base their work on it or not), your published
repository will be set up by default to deny any non-fast-forward
pushes. This is done for the reason we have been talking about --
it would make it impossible for others to track the code and merge
it into their local clones. So, if you plan on publishing rebased
branches (with warnings to downstream developers to only cherry
pick from it), you still will have to force the push.
</p></li>
<li>

The distribution and its users. This is a very important
constituency; and most of us packaging software for distributions
are doing all this work precisely for this constituency. Through
the integration branch, this is a downstream branch &ndash; though one
interesting case study uses a single rebased patch branch and throw
away integration branches, using a patch series in the integration
branch.  Since you control the integration branch, this is not
strictly downstream,

</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, depending on where you are on the totem pole, some of these
constituencies are more important than others. At the very top, you
don't have an upstream. For example, Git development. They just use a
mainline, and a rebased pending updates branch. All their downstream
is cautioned never to base work on the pending updates series. So,
rebased lines of development work for them, since they are upstream,
and that is the most important constituency in their work-flow.
</p>
<p>

If you are too low on the totem pole to have any downstream
developers, and you can live with throw away integration branches,
rebased lines of development work as well. But as soon as you have
downstream developers <b>or</b> you are working with other people (yourself
on your laptop is another person as well), rebasing stops being an
option. A major advantage of a distributed SCM is for accessing the
repository from different locations; if you do, rebase messes with
that.

<div style="display: block; visibility: visible;" id="text-3">


<p>

Are the stake holders the only factor in you decision? Not by a long
shot. Take, for instance, the issue of how active your independent
lines of development are, and how big the patch series is, and whether
you want to do a functional test for each topic branch.
</p>

<ul>
<li>

Small, inactive topic branch

<p>

If you have a single, small patch ( a simple bug fix, for example), you
can just create a branch, apply the bug fix to the integration branch,
and just let the branch be.
</p>
<p>

As upstream development happens, it gets merged into the integration
branch where you have already merged your bug fix branch 
</p><ul>
<li>

if there is no conflict on the integration branch, don't do
anything.
</li>
<li>

If there is a conflict, then you have a couple of options:
<ul>
<li>

resolve the conflict on the integration branch, and merge the
mainline into the topic branch (aka bug fix branch), resolve the
conflict the same way you did in the integration branch, and let
it be. This is delayed integration into topic branches.

<p>

The problem is that with this method you can never merge back
into the integration branch without any conflicts: since now you
have two different commits on the topic branch and the
integration branch making the same changes. This is only
feasible if you only cherry pick real changes from your topic
branches into your integration branch, and it makes easier to
miss fixes (since you are making the same change twice).
</p></li>
<li>

Back out the merge on the integration branch. Merge the upstream
into the topic branch, resolve the conflict, and then merge that
fix into the integration branch.

</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>It might be better just to merge upstream into your topic branches
first, resolving conflicts as you go, and then merge all topic
branches into you integration branch, bringing in all the fixes. You
might have to do some additional conflict resolution in the
integration branch, depending on the overlap in your topics. This is
the only viable option for larger or more active topic branches, so
special casing for small topic branches is probably not worth the
effort.
</p>
</li>
<li>

Larger patch-sets

<p>

For a large patch on a topic branch, the chances are that you'll
have to merge almost every upstream version, since the chances are
higher of some changes overlapping; might as well get into a pattern
of merging the upstream branch into all the topic branches, and,
indirectly, the integration branch.  Also, if there are downstream
developers (more likely with large features like this), you need to
keep the topic branch(es) up to date.
</p>
</li>
<li>

Active development

<p>

If your topic branch is being actively developed, you need to
constantly merge it into your integration branch. Whenever upstream
updates happen, you need to merge the upstream branch into the topic
branch, and then merge the topic branch into the integration
branches. Again, delayed integration of the upstream branch into the
topic branches is unlikely to work well, and works not at all if you
have downstream developers basing their work on your topic branches.

<div style="display: block; visibility: visible;" id="text-4">


<ul>
<li>

Testing each topic branch independently

<p>

If you or a downstream developer need to compile and test each topic
branch independently (instead of all together, in the integration
branch), you must merge each upstream change into a feature
branch. Rebasing or not depends on whether or not the branch has been
published.
</p>
</li>
<li>

Public or private topic branches

<p>

If your topic branches are public, then rebasing is out &ndash; unless
you have strong warnings in place about people not basing their work
on this branch. Rewriting history (which is what a rebase is) out
from under people basing their work on yours is rude, and may cause
a lot of work to stitch things back together.
</p>
</li>
<li>

Team or collaborative development

<p>

If you are packaging software as a part of a team, team members need
to have access to each other's branches (to pick up if you are busy,
to see pending changes, to avoid duplication of work). This means
public topic branches, and thus no rebasing.

A, B, C and D. There are two topic or feature branches, labeled
"topic/a" and "topic/b", one of which has two commits, and the other
one has one commit.  In all the examples, there are four Debian
releases that happen during the interval tracked.  I have created
these examples with an explicit upstream tracking branch; you can get
away with fetch and origin/naster if you do not want a local tracking
branch.  The dotted lines represent a topic branch earlier in the
history of the workflow which got rebased away (to get the final
state, pretend that the nodes linked by the dotted lines do not

As mentioned earlier, The dotted lines represent a topic branch
earlier in the history of the workflow. I want to stress that his
work-flow has limited utility; and only when you do not have people
basing their work off your banches. Since you never know who might
want to base their work off you in the future &hellip;
</p>
<p>

In this case, the release is made off a throw away release branch,
which essentially becomes unusable as soon as a new upstream release
comes and there is a rebase operation. However, at any given time, the
rebased topic branch is nice, clean, and rebased against the latest
upstream, making it really easy to feed patchs into the upstream code.
</p>
<p>

However, downstream developers are seriously incovenienced, since all
the branches are either thro away or rebased.

The scenario is identical to the rebase case, witht he difference that
we carry an additional set of branches around for the downstream
folks, but we still release from throw away branches.  This is almost
strictly worse than the next case, since derivative distributors for
not have a stable branch from which the packages are built &ndash; since we
are building packages from a throw away branch.
</p>
<p>

In the figure, the two "for downstream" branches are never rebased,
always merge with upstream, and cherry pick changes from the current
topic branches. If there is overlap, integration work will have to be
done separately in the "for downstream" branches (but will often be
the same disambiguation logic as was needed when rebasing the topic
branch). The "for downstream" branches are just like the branches in
the pure merge case above; with the difference that merges into the
master branch are not happening (since we do not have a long lasting
integration branch in this scenario).

This is my preferred mechnism. I only create the submit branches on
demand; and the submit branches are cherry picked and rebased from the
topic branches when I am ready to submit patches upstream &ndash; so in
reality, my work-flow is really like the plain merged branches above,
with the proviso that I can create the submit branches easily if I
needed. 
</p>
<p>

The submit branches, when they exist, look very much like the topic
branches in the pure rebase case, except that we never gather them to
make a release (since the release is done off the topic branches, not
the submit branch set).

  <pre>  git checkout upstream
  git pull origin

  # the submit branch creation is optional
  git checkout submit/a
  git rebase upstream
  git checkout submit/b
  git rebase upstream

  git checkout topic/a
  git merge upstream
  git checkout topic/b
  git merge upstream
  git checkout master
  git merge topic/a  topic/b
  # do the release thing
  git commit
  </pre>

Based on which stake-holders you have, and which ones are most
important to you, how big your topic branch differences are, and how
active the topic development is, you can decide whether or not you
rebase or merge, and whether you do delayed integration into topic
branches or not.
</p>
<p>

Now for my personal preferences: I am low down on the totem pole,
mostly, but I like to publish my topic branches. So I will not rebase
my public topic branches. I will have persistent integration branches,
since derived distribution folks are likely to need that. I will also
always merge new upstream into my topic branches, just in case someone
is basing their work off my public topic branch.
</p>
<p>

But since I have to cater to upstream as well, I plan on having a
private, rebasable submission branch for each topic; and cherry pick
original commits from the topic branch on to that. The submission
branches will be rebased before submitting to the latest upstream
version before submission, or more often if I feel like doing so.
</p>
<p>

The topic branches will be named "topic/foo". submission branches will
be named "submission/foo", and there will be a "tmp/bar" name space
for ephemeral branches. This will make it easier to script things like
new upstream versions.
