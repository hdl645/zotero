                <p>Quick introduction to <a class="reference" href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a> internals for people who are not
scared by words like <a class="reference" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">Directed Acyclic Graph</a>.</p>

                </h1>
                <p>In simplified form, git object storage is "just" a DAG of objects,
with a handful of different types of objects. They are all stored
compressed and identified by an SHA-1 hash (that, incidentally,
<em>isn't</em> the SHA-1 of the contents of the file they represent, but
of their representation in git).</p>

                  <img alt="git-storage.1.png" src="git-storage.1.png">
                  <p class="caption"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">blob</span></tt>: The simplest object, just a bunch of bytes. This is often
a file, but can be a symlink or pretty much anything else. The
object that points to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">blob</span></tt> determines the semantics.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="figure">
                  <img alt="git-storage.2.png" src="git-storage.2.png">
                  <p class="caption"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tree</span></tt>: Directories are represented by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tree</span></tt> object. They
refer to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">blob</span></tt>s that have the contents of files (filename,
access mode, etc is all stored in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tree</span></tt>), and to other
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tree</span></tt>s for subdirectories.</p>
                  <div class="legend">

When a node points to another node in the DAG, it <em>depends</em> on the
other node: it cannot exist without it. Nodes that nothing points
to can be garbage collected with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span><span class="pre">gc</span></tt>, or rescued much like
filesystem inodes with no filenames pointing to them with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span><span class="pre">lost-found</span></tt>.</div>
                </div>

                  <p class="caption"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">commit</span></tt>: A <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">commit</span></tt> refers to a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tree</span></tt> that represents the
state of the files at the time of the commit. It also refers to
0..<cite>n</cite> other <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">commit</span></tt>s that are its parents. More than one
parent means the commit is a merge, no parents means it is an
initial commit, and interestingly there can be more than one
initial commit; this usually means two separate projects
merged. The body of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">commit</span></tt> object is the commit message.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="figure">
                  <img alt="git-storage.4.png" src="git-storage.4.png">
                  <p class="caption"><cite>refs</cite>: References, or heads or branches, are like post-it notes
slapped on a node in the DAG. Where as the DAG only gets added to
and existing nodes cannot be mutated, the post-its can be moved
around freely. They don't get stored in the history, and they
aren't directly transferred between repositories. They act as sort
of bookmarks, "I'm working here".</p>
                  <div class="legend">
                    <p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span><span class="pre">commit</span></tt> adds a node to the DAG and moves the post-it note
for current branch to this new node.</p>
                    <p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">HEAD</span></tt> ref is special in that it actually points to another
ref. It is a pointer to the currently active branch. Normal refs
are actually in a namespace <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">heads/XXX</span></tt>, but you can often skip
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">heads/</span></tt> part.</p>

                  <p class="caption"><cite>remote refs</cite>: Remote references are post-it notes of a different
color. The difference to normal <cite>refs</cite> is the different namespace,
and the fact that remote refs are essentially controlled by the
remote server. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span><span class="pre">fetch</span></tt> updates them.</p>
                </div>

                  <p class="caption"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tag</span></tt>: A <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tag</span></tt> is both a node in the DAG and a post-it note (of
yet another color). A <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tag</span></tt> points to a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">commit</span></tt>, and includes
an optional message and a GPG signature.</p>
                  <div class="legend">

The post-it is just a fast way to access the tag, and if lost can
be recovered from just the DAG with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span><span class="pre">lost-found</span></tt>.</div>
                </div>
                <p>The nodes in the DAG can be moved from repository to repository, can
be stored in more effective form (packs), and unused nodes can be
garbage collected. But in the end, a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt> repository is always just
a DAG and post-its.</p>

                <p>So, armed with that knowledge on how <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt> stores the version

yet published your branch, or have clearly communicated that others
should not base their work on it, you have an alternative. You can
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rebase</span></tt> your branch, where instead of merging, your commit is
replaced by another commit with a different parent, and your branch
is moved there.</p>
                  <div class="legend">
                    <p>Your old commit(s) will remain in the DAG until garbage collected.
Ignore them for now, but just know there's a way out if you screwed
up totally. If you have extra post-its pointing to your old commit,
they will remain pointing to it, and keep your old commit alive
indefinitely. That can be fairly confusing, though.</p>
                    <p>Don't rebase branches that others have created new commits on top
of. It is possible to recover from that, it's not hard, but the
extra work needed can be frustrating.</p>
